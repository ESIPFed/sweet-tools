This is a repo to host utilities, programs, scripts, etc., 
related with management and manipulation of the 
[SWEET](https://github.com/ESIPFed/sweet) ontology files.

At the moment this is a flexible space, feel free to use it as
needed. There's no a particular structure in mind other than
perhaps organize this space in subdirectories by main language
or function.
Just put a README.md under any new subdirectory to explain its
contents.
