        skos:definition  "Muon Particle ? Myon\n\nElectrically charged instable elementary particle with a rest\nenergy of 105.658 MeV corresponding to 206.786 times the rest\nenergy of an electron (0.511 MeV). The muon has an average\nhalf-life of 2.2 ? 10-6 s. The muon belongs to the elementary\nparticle group of the leptons.\n\nMost cosmic rays are protons, which are abundant in the\nuniverse.  Primary cosmic rays are particles (ionized atoms)\nsuch as a single proton (nuclei of hydrogen; about 90% of all\ncosmic rays) up to an iron nucleus and beyond, but being\ntypically protons and alpha particles (identical to helium\nnuclei; majority of the remaining 10%) traveling through the\ninterstellar medium. Most of these originate outside of our\nsolar system (i.e. from Supernovae), but some of them come from\nsun.\n\nWhen these primary cosmic rays hit Earth's atmosphere at around\n30,000m above the surface, the impacts cause nuclear reactions,\nwhich produce pions. These pions decay into a muon and muon\nneutrino (= antineutrino) at about 9000 m altitude, which rain\ndown upon the surface of the earth, traveling at about\n0.998c. Many muons decay on the way down into Neutrinos and an\nelectron while others reach the surface, but there are still\nenough to be detected fairly easy. Actually, about 200 rain down\non each square meter of Earth every second.\n\nWe detect the muons by utilizing a homebrew Geiger-M?ller\ndetector. The Geiger counters are supplied by high voltage,\nwhich creates a very high electric field near the anode of the\ndetectors. When a cosmic particle enters one detector, it strips\noff some electrons of some atoms. These electrons move towards\nthe positively charged wires, are accelerated by the huge\nelectric field and have enough energy to strip more electrons\nfrom other gas molecules. These electrons are accelerated too in\norder to strip more and more electrons. This electric avalanche\nconsisting of more than a billion negative charges rains down on\nthe positively charged wire, causing a current that flows into\nthe simple detection circuit.\n\nSince other particles are stimulating the detector aswell, we\nwill use 2 detectors to avoid false detection. Other particles\noriginating from i.e. terrestrial radiation will also cause a\nstimulation, but those particles have too less energy to\npenetrate both detectors. They will end up either in the first\ndetector or shortly after it. So we simply have to look for\nalmost instant detections in both detectors and consider this as\nsuccessful detection.\n\nAdditional information available at\n\"http://muon.captain.at/\"\n\n\n"@en ;

As ion passes through a thin carbon\nfoil to enter the time-of-flight system secondary electrons are scattered and\ncollected by a microchannel plate (MCP) to generate a start signal. The\nharmonic potential causes the ion to travel in a parabolic trajectory,\nimpinging on a second MCP to create the stop signal. The potential also causes\nthe time-of-flight (calculated from the start and stop pulses) to be only a\nfunction of the mass/charge* of the particle, where the charge is that of the\nion after passing through the carbon foil. Since most of the particles emerge\neither neutral or singly charged the calculated time-of- flight is proportional\nto mass (a time-of-flight is not determined for the neutral particles).\n\nFor more information, see:\nhttp://space.umd.edu/wind/sms.html\n"@en ;

It is a five-channel microwave instrument intended primarily to measure profiles of atmospheric humidity. It is also sensitive to liquid water in clouds and measures cloud liquid water content. Additionally, it provides qualitative estimates of the precipitation rate. \n\nBecause of the high variability of atmospheric water, the MHS has a higher resolution than the AMSU-A, with an approximate 16-km (1 mi) diameter circular field of view at nadir. Ninety such fields of view are measure in each cross-track scan. The instrument has approximately the same swath width as AMSU-A but scans across-track in one-third the time in order to keep the two instruments synchronized. By this means, arrays of 3 x 3 MHS samples will overlay each AMSU-A sample, facilitating synergistic use of these instruments. \n\nMHS has four humidity channels in the 157 GHz to 190 GHz range. As with AMSU-A, it also has a surface-viewing window channel at 89 GHz, partly to ensure cross-registration of the two sounding instruments.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: MHS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Profilers/Sounders\n      Short_Name: MHS\n      Long_Name: Microwave Humidity Sounder\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: NOAA-19\n      Short_Name: NOAA-18\n      Short_Name: METOP-A\n      Short_Name: METOP-B\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Microwave\n      Number_Channels: 5\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 89.0 GHz - 190.31 GHz\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/pod-guide/ncdc/docs/klm/html/c3/sec3-9.htm\n   Online_Resource: http://wdc.dlr.de/sensors/mhs/\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NOAA\n      Instrument_Owner: EUMETSAT\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

The positive-ion composition measurement includes five miniature\nimaging mass spectrometers at the exit aperture of the analyzer, and covers\nmasses from 1 to 550 u/Q at 100 eV, and 1 to 55 u/Q at 10 keV. The hot plasma\nanalyzer measures electrons and ions in the range 1-50,000 eV/Q. The solar wind\nanalyzer measures ions from 150 to 7,000 eV/Q.

This set of instruments is designed to provide\nreal-time measurement of space weather: solar activity, the\ncharged particle environment, and the Earth's magnetic field at\nsynchronous orbit.\n\nThe magnetometer measures the magnitude and direction of the\nEarth's ambient magnetic field with three orthogonal sensors,\nlocated in a sensor assembly and attached to a boom that places\nthe sensor three meters away from the body of the spacecraft.\n\nThe Energetic Particle Sensor (EPS) and the High-Energy Proton\nand Alpha Detector (HEPAD) monitor solar protons and alpha\nparticles, produced during large flares, which are a radiation\nhazard to manned and unmanned operations in space and the\nionosphere at high latitudes. The HEPAD instrument covers the\nvery high-energy protons and alpha particles that are produced\nin large solar flares.\n\nThe X-Ray Sensor performs real-time measurements of the solar\nX-ray emissions in two channels covering the spectral ranges of\n0.5 Angstroms (shortwave) and 1 to 9 angstroms (longwave). The\nsensitivity of the sensor was chosen to permit quiet sun\nbackground measurements at as low a level of solar activity as\npossible while detecting events at the lowest practicable\nthreshold for early event warning.\n\nThe Future: Solar X-Ray Imager\n\"http://www.spaceweather.noaa.gov/stories/sw2b.htm\"\n\n[Source: NOAA]\n\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "The Energetic Particle Experiment (EPE) aboard IMP-8 was one of the first low\nenergy (tens of keV) magnetic/solid state detector ion-electron separation and\nanalysis systems flown in space. The Principal Investigator is D. J. Williams.\nFurther instrumental details are summarized by Williams [NOAA Tech. Rpt. ERL\n393-SEL 40, 1977]. The EPE on IMP-8 has operated successfully for 28 years and\nhave generated a wealth of high-quality data that have led to new discoveries\nand have resulted in hundreds of publications. Both the CPME and EPE\ninstruments continued to perform without problems until IMP-8 operations were\nterminated by NASA at the end of October 2001.\n\nThe EPE cleanly separates ions and electrons in the energy range for 30 keV\nthrough several MeV. In addition to the magnetic deflection system,\ncomplementary particle observations are obtained from a low-noise detector (~18\nkeV discriminator level) and a thin (~5 micron) detector.\n\nOne full 15 degree viewing cone perpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis\n(nearly normal to the ecliptic plane) and two full 13 degree viewing cones 45\ndegree to the spin axis are used for the EPE particle observations. Angular\ndistributions are measured by obtaining 8 or 16 samples (depending on particle\ntype and energy) per satellite spin period. Orientations of the 16, 22.5-degree\n(full-angle) sectors of the EPE on IMP-8 are illustrated in EPE sector look\ndirections. A complete energy-angular distribution is obtained every 20.4\nseconds.\n\nThe EPE particle detector assembly consists of a main magnet-detector assembly\nand two auxiliary detector heads. All detectors are fully depleted, surface\nbarrier, solid state detectors, and are operated with bias voltages 1.25-1.5\ntimes the values required for full depletion. To minimize radiation damage\neffects, all detectors directly exposed to ion fluxes are mounted with the\naluminum contact exposed to the incoming beam.\n\nFor more information, see:\nhttp://sd-www.jhuapl.edu/IMP/imp_index.html\n"@en ;

The satellite was launched on 12 September 1991 as a part of NASA's effort to study the Earth's stratosphere and mesosphere. UARS was the first satellite in NASA's Mission to Planet Earth. HRDI observed the emission and absorption lines of molecular oxygen (and other atmospheric components) in small volumes (4 km in height by 50 km in width) above the limb of the Earth. From the Doppler shift of the lines, the horizontal winds can be determined to an accuracy of ~5 m s-1, while the line shapes and strengths yield information about the temperature and atmospheric species, such as mesospheric ozone. The HRDI instrument conducted scientific measurements from November 1991 until April 2005. The UARS spacecraft was deactivated on 14 December 2005 at 17:16:37z, completing 78084 orbits over 5208 mission days. The UARS spacecraft is expected to re-enter the atmosphere sometime in 2009 or 2010. \n\nWind measurements from the TIDI instrument on the TIMED satellite provide overlapping measurements with HRDI from early 2002 through the end of the UARS mission. TIDI observations continue to the current time. \n\nThe primary purpose of this site is to make HRDI data available to the scientific community.

The pictures could be transmitted to APT stations using the real-time transmission system (RTTS) or stored on magnetic tape for subsequent playback to ground acquisition stations. The camera was mounted on the bottom of the satellite sensory ring and pointed vertically down toward the earth at all times. The image dissector was a shutterless electronic scan and step tube mounted behind a wide-angle (108 deg), 5.7-mm focal length lens. Scanning and stepping functions occurred continuously while the satellite progressed along its orbital path. The field of view of the optics was 73.6 deg in the direction of flight and 98.2 deg in a plane normal to the direction of flight. The image was focused by the optics on a photosensitive surface of the image dissector tube. A line-scanning beam scanned the photosensitive surface at 4 Hz with a frame period of 200 s. At the nominal spacecraft altitude of 1100 km, each resulting picture was approximately 1400 km on a side, with a ground resolution of 3 km at nadir. For a more detailed description, see Section 2 of \"The Nimbus III User's Guide\" (TRF B03409). The experiment was a success and produced good data until September 25, 1970, when operations were terminated owing to spacecraft yaw problems. Data from this experiment are available through SDSD. The IDCS world montages were presented in \"The Nimbus III Data Catalog\" (TRF B06523), available from NSSDC.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: IDCS NIMBUS-3\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Photon/Optical Detectors\n      Instrument_Subtype: Cameras\n      Short_Name: IDCS NIMBUS-3\n      Long_Name: Image Dissector Camera System on NIMBUS-3\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: NIMBUS-3\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1969-037A-06\n   Creation_Date: 2013-03-28\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "[Source: National Space Science Data Center, http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1969-037A-05 ]\n\nThe Nimbus 3 Medium-Resolution Infrared Radiometer (MRIR) experiment measured the intensity and distribution of the electromagnetic radiation emitted by and reflected from the earth and its atmosphere in five selected wavelength intervals from 0.2 to 23 micrometers. Data on the heat balance of the earth-atmosphere system were obtained as well as water vapor distribution data, surface or near-surface temperatures, and data on seasonal changes of stratospheric temperature distribution. The five wavelength regions were (1) the 6.5- to 7.0-micrometer channel, which covered the 6.7-micrometer water vapor absorption band, (2) the 10- to 11-micrometer band, which operated in the atmospheric window, (3) the 14.5- to 15.5-micrometer band, which covered the 15-micrometer carbon dioxide absorption band, (4) the 20- to 23-micrometer channel, which covered the spectral region containing the broad rotational absorption bands of water vapor, and (5) the 0.2- to 4.0-micrometer channel, which yielded information on the intensity of reflected solar energy. Radiant energy from the earth was collected by a flat scanning mirror inclined at 45 deg to the optical axis. The mirror rotated at 8 rpm and scanned in a plane perpendicular to the direction of motion of the satellite. Each of the five channels contained a 4.33-cm diameter folded telescope with a 2.8-deg field of view and a thermistor bolometer. The collected energy was modulated by a mechanical chopper to produce an ac signal. The signal was then amplified and recorded on magnetic tape for subsequent playback to a ground acquisition station. At a satellite altitude of 1100 km, a horizontal resolution of 45 km was obtained. The MRIR experiment was successful, in spite of a telemetry conflict that caused the experiment to be periodically turned off. During August and September 1970 (hurricane season), the MRIR was on essentially full time to cover the area from the equator to 70 deg N and from 10 deg E to 100 deg W. On September 25, 1970, the satellite's rear horizon scanner failed, making it impossible to determine where the MRIR sensor was pointing. The experiment was operated periodically until January 22, 1972, when all spacecraft operations were terminated.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: MRIR/NIMBUS-3\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Radiometers\n      Short_Name: MRIR/NIMBUS-3\n      Long_Name: Medium-Resolution Infrared Radiometer on NIMBUS-3\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: NIMBUS-3\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Infrared > Thermal\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 6.5 μm - 7.0 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Infrared > Thermal\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 10 μm - 11 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Infrared > Thermal\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 14.5 μm - 15.5 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Infrared > Thermal\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 20 μm - 23 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Infrared > Reflected\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.2 μm - 4.0 μm\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1966-040A-03\n   Online_Resource: http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/nimbus \n   Online_Resource: http://atmospheres.gsfc.nasa.gov/nimbus/\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "[Source: NASA THEMIS home page, \nhttp://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/themis/spacecraft/SST.html ]\n\nThe Solid State Telescope (SST) measures superthermal particle distribution functions, namely the number of ions and electrons coming towards the spacecraft from specified directions with specified energies within the energy range from 25 keV to 6 MeV. These particles are the much more energetic (hence superthermal) than the main magnetospheric population, but are quite important as tracers of acceleration and heating in the magnetosphere. SST observations help us achieve the objectives of the THEMIS mission by providing two different measurements of substorm onset within the Earth’s plasma sheet, a region of enhanced particle fluxes and depressed magnetic field strengths within the Earth’s magnetotail. The first method is based on the fact that the plasma sheet slowly thins prior to substorm onset, but rapidly expands at onset. Using the so-called ‘finite gyroradius’ effect, the SST can remotely sense the location and motion of the boundaries of the plasma sheet, in particular the expansion at substorm onset. This is the first time that two SSTs will track this changing boundary from three locations while other instruments at different locations in the magnetosphere are determining the time of substorm onset.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: THEMIS-SST\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Solar/Space Observing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Particle Detectors\n      Short_Name: THEMIS-SST\n      Long_Name: THEMIS Solid State Telescope\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: THEMIS\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/themis/spacecraft/SST.html\n   Online_Resource: http://themis.ssl.berkeley.edu/instrument_sst.shtml\n   Sample_Image: http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/168041main_SST-FM1_med.jpg\n   Creation_Date: 2008-08-13\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "The SuperSTAR accelerometer manufactured by ONERA/CNES (France) is a modified version of the ASTRE high precision accelerometer previously flown on different Shuttle-missions (Life and Microgravity Science Mission (STS-78, 1996), Microgravity Science Laboratory (STS-83, STS-94, 1997)) and the STAR accelerometer which will be operated on the CHAMP satellite.\n\nThe accelerometer serves to measure all non-gravitational accelerations on the GRACE satellite due to air drag, solar radiation pressure or attitude control activator impulses initiated by the attitude and orbit control system (AOCS). In combination with the sub-mm intersatellite distance observed by the k-band ranging system (KBR) and the accurate satellite position measured by the onboard GPS receiver, the Earth's gravity field can be deduced with unprecedented accuracy.\n\nThe measurement principle of the SuperSTAR accelerometer is based on the electrostatic suspension of a parallel-epipedic proof-mass inside a cage. The cage walls are equipped with control electrodes which serve both as capacitive sensors to derive the instantaneous proof-mass (PM) position and as actuators to apply electrostatic forces in order to keep the PM motionless in the centre of the cage. Because the ACC sensor is hard-mounted with the GRACE satellite body, the amount of these control forces in combination with the well known proof-mass  can be used to derive the acceleration vector for any moment of time.\n\nThe PM has to be positioned very precisely at the Center of Gravity (CoG) of the GRACE satellite to avoid acceleration offsets and measurement disturbances. In order to meet the very high requirements for GRACE gravity recovery this offset shall be measured with an accuracy of 50 Âµm in all 3 axis and corrected by a Center of Mass Trim Assembly (CMT). The planned resolution of the CHAMP STAR accelerometer is 1 Â· 10-9  ms-2  integrated over the frequency bandwith of 2 x 10-4  Hz to 0.1 Hz. Its full measurement range is 10-3  ms-2 . Because of the low-vibration design of the GRACE spacecraft and the high temperature stability (below 0.1Â° Celsius) the SuperSTAR ACC full scale range will be increased to 5 Â· 10-5  ms-2 . Additional improvements (proof mass offset voltage reduction from 20V to 10V, smaller acceleration bias and bias fluctuations by a factor of 20) increases the GRACE ACC resolution to 1 Â· 10-10  ms-2 . For the correct interpretation of the ACC measurements the attitude of the ACC will be measured very precisely by a star camera assembly (SCA).\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: GRACE ACC\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Magnetic/Motion Sensors\n      Instrument_Subtype: Accelerometers\n      Short_Name: GRACE ACC\n      Long_Name: GRACE SuperSTAR Accelerometer\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: GRACE\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: RADIO\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 10-3 ms-2\n      Spectral_Frequency_Resolution: 2 x 10-4  Hz to 0.1 Hz\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://eospso.gsfc.nasa.gov/eos_homepage/mission_profiles/docs/GRACE.pdf\n   Online_Resource: http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/portal/\n   Online_Resource: http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/\n   Creation_Date: 2013-01-29\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n      Instrument_Owner: GFZ Potsdam\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "The Polar Ionospheric X-ray Imaging Experiment (PIXIE) onboard the POLAR\nspacecraft is described. The PIXIE instrument will measure the spatial\ndistribution and temporal variation of x-ray emissions in the energy range 3 to\n60 keV from the earth's atmosphere. From these x-ray measurements, the\nmorphology and spectra of energetic electron precipitation and its effects upon\nthe atmosphere can be derived.\n\nThe Polar Ionospheric X-ray Imaging Experiment (PIXIE) will provide global\nmeasurements of the spatial distribution and temporal variation of\nbremsstrahlung x-ray emissions from the earth's atmosphere. From these x-ray\nmeasurements, the morphology and spectra of energetic electron precipitation\nand the effects upon the atmosphere can be derived. The measurements can be\nused to estimate the total rate of electron energy deposition and the energy\ndistribution of the precipitating electrons. The electron energy distribution\ncan then be used to compute the altitude profile of ionization and electrical\nconductivity. All of these quantities will be derived for the entire auroral\nzone simultaneously. PIXIE x-ray measurements can be made on the day side of\nthe earth as well as the night, and the precipitating electron intensities and\nenergy spectra can be derived from the x-ray images. These are unique\ncapabilities that cannot be duplicated by optical or UV devices. Images of\natmospheric bremsstrahlung emission will be obtained over the energy range of 3\nto 60 keV with good spatial and energy resolution, and with sufficient time\nresolution (a few minutes) to generate movies of the dynamical variations of\nauroral luminosities and associated atmospheric effects.\n\nThe design of an instrument for mapping bremsstrahlung x-rays and the plans for\non-orbit operations and data analysis should be based on actual measurements of\nbremsstrahlung x-rays at satellite altitudes. For these purposes, we have\nformulated representative spectra and intensities based on the only existing\nsets of satellite bremsstrahlung data. (These data were acquired by the\nLockheed and Aerospace groups - Imhof et al., 1974, 1981, 1985; Datlowe et al.,\n1988; Mizera et al., 1978, 1984; Gorney, 1987) . Previous instruments viewed a\nrelatively small region below a low-altitude spacecraft and, therefore, do not\ngive a global picture, but the data can be taken as representative of certain\nclasses of auroral events. The two physical parameters that are crucial in\ndetermining global upper atmospheric processes are the total energy input to\nthe high latitude regions of the atmosphere and the spectrum of the\nprecipitating electron fluxes which provide a highly variable and significant\nportion of that energy. Based on our data taken from low-altitude polar\norbiting satellites, bremsstrahlung x-rays can be used to deduce these\nparameters. \n\nFor more information, see:\nhttp://pixie.spasci.com/\nand\nhttp://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/polar/polar_inst.shtml\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: PIXIE\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Solar/Space Observing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: X-Ray/Gamma Ray Detectors\n      Short_Name: PIXIE\n      Long_Name: Polar Ionospheric X-Ray Imaging Experiment\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: POLAR\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://pixie.spasci.com/\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 1996-02-24\n      Instrument_Owner: Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space Company\n      Instrument_Owner: Aerospace Corporation\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "[Source: ESA's Gravity Mission GOCE Brochure, http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/BR209web.pdf ] \n\nThe principle of operation of the gradiometer relies on  measuring the forces that maintain a ‘proof mass’ at the centre  of a specially engineered ‘cage’. Servo-controlled electrostatic  suspension provides control of the ‘proof mass’ in terms of  linear and rotational motion. Three pairs of identical  accelerometers, which form three ‘gradiometer arms’, are  mounted on the ultra-stable structure. The difference between  accelerations measured by each of two accelerometers (which  are about 50 cm apart), in the direction joining them, is the  basic gradiometric datum. The average of the two accelerations  is proportional to the externally induced drag acceleration  (common mode measurement). The three arms are mounted  orthogonal to one another: one aligned with the satellite’s  trajectory, one perpendicular to the trajectory, and one  pointing approximately towards the centre of the Earth. By  combining the differential accelerations, it is possible to derive  the gravity gradient components as well as the perturbing  angular accelerations.  \n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: EGG\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: In Situ/Laboratory Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Magnetic/Motion Sensors\n      Instrument_Type: Accelerometers\n      Short_Name: EGG\n      Long_Name: Electrostatic Gravity Gradiometer\n   End_Group\n   Group: Instrument_Associated_Sensors\n      Short_Name: ACCELEROMETERS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: GOCE\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://esamultimedia.esa.int/docs/BR209web.pdf\n   Online_Resource: http://www.esa.int/esaLP/ESAHTK1VMOC_LPgoce_0.html\n   Creation_Date: 2009-05-15\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 2009-03-20\n      Instrument_Owner: ESA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "The main objective of the Solar Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SUSIM) experiment was to measure with high precision full-disk solar fluxes and their changes over a solar activity cycle in the 120-400 nm wavelength region. The SUSIM experiment on all three Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science (ATLAS) missions flew concurrently with another SUSIM experiment onboard the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) and was able to provide correlative measurements and calibration checks. The goals of the SUSIM experiment are (1) to improve the absolute accuracy of solar continuum irradiance measurements in the 140-400 nm region to plus or minus 6 to 10 % (wavelength-dependent), (2) improve the absolute accuracy of solar emission line irradiance measurements in the 120-400 nm region to plus or minus 6 to 10% (wavelength-dependent), (3) measure with high accuracy the intensities of the continuum below 208 nm relative to the intensities of the continuum above 208 nm to plus or minus 1%, (4) measure with high accuracy the intensities of solar emission lines below 208 nm relative to the stable solar continuum above 208 nm to plus or minus 1 to 5 % (wavelength-dependent), (5) measure the degree of correlation of the solar flares in the 120-400 nm region with ground observations. The instrument consists of two identical double-dispersion scanning spectrometers, seven detectors (five photodiodes and two photon counters), a UV calibration source, and a Sun sensor. The spectrometers and detectors are sealed in a canister filled with 1.1 atm of argon gas to eliminate contamination of the optics. One spectrometer is used continuously to measure the solar intensities while the other monitor is used once a day to track the stability of the first spectrometer. The two photon counters obtain a spectral resolution of 0.15 nm while the photodiodes obtain a spectral resolution of 5 nm. A deuterium lamp transfer standard is built into the instrument for calibration of the seven detectors. \n\nThe Space Shuttle Discovery carrying UARS was launched on September 12, 1991 from Kennedy Space Flight Center. UARS was released to orbit on September 15, 1991, and the Solar Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SUSIM) began scientific observations of the earth's upper atmosphere October 11, 1991. \n\nFor centuries, the number of sunspots has been observed to vary on an 11 year cycle. Measurements during the last two solar cycles have shown that sunspot numbers and the magnitude of solar UV light are correlated. Solar UV light can only be accurately measured from outside the Earth's atmosphere because this is where most of it is absorbed. To observe the sun in the UV over an entire 11 year solar cycle, a satellite-based experiment is the most practical means. SUSIM UARS makes measurements over its 115-410 nm wavelength range daily at 1 and 5 nm resolutions and weekly at 0.15 nm resolution. It is hoped through elaborate and painstaking calibrations made both before and during flight that the calibration of the instrument can be maintained to an absolute accuracy of 6% and a relative accuracy of 2% for the duration of a solar cycle. \n\nSUSIM UARS also observes occultations of the sun by the Earth's atmosphere. Through comparison of the amount of UV light of selected wavelengths that penetrate the atmosphere as a function of altitude, densities of upper atmosphere UV light absorbers molecular oxygen and ozone are measured. \n\nThe experiment is operated as a part of the SUSIM Program by the NRL SUSIM UARS team through daily command streams sent via the NASA GSFC UARS Payload Operations Control Center. The raw SUSIM data is downlinked through the NASA Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, the NASA Communications Network, and the GSFC Data Capture Facility, to the UARS Central Data Handling Facility (CDHF). The CDHF processes the data based on algorithms and calibrations developed by the SUSIM UARS team to produce absolutely calibrated irradiances at instrument resolution for each solar scan. A subset of these data are processed further each day to produce 1 nm integrated irradiances at 1 nm intervals and the values of 7 solar indices. \n\nSUSIM UARS Principal Investigator: Guenter E.

In addition, the system is being used to study near-nadir\nocean backscatter and its relation to wind waves. The sensor is\ntypically flown on one of several NASA aircraft and is potentially\navailable for outside use in funded ocean research efforts. Currently,\nROWS research efforts are aimed at improving the interpretation of\nocean data collected using the satellite SAR (ERS-1), altimeter(TOPEX)\nand scatterometer (NSCAT).\n\nThe airborne system has participated in numerous ocean surface\nmeasurement programs since since the late 1970s. ROWS has been\ninstalled on numerous aircraft, most recently NASA/GSFC/WFF's T-39 and\nP-3B. The system is typically operated from altitudes of 5-10 km.\n\nThe high-range-resolution radar generates data using two distinct,\ncontinuously-operating modes. Spectrometer mode data are collected\nwith a near-vertically-pointing, pencil-beam antenna which rotates in\nazimuth. These data are used to derive two- dimensional ocean wave\nspectral estimates and near-nadir directional radar backscatter\ninformation. Concurrent pulse-limited altimeter mode radar returns are\nderived using a vertically-pointed horn antenna.

The SXT itself was conceived and built by\nthe National Observatory of Japan and the Lockheed Martin Solar\nand Astrophysics Laboratory. The scientific planning for SXT,\nand its operation, has involved scientific groups in Japan and\nthe USA.

This subsequently evolved into the\nfamiliar and powerful SolarSoft system now in use by many solar\ngroups for a large variety of experiments.\n\nThe Yohkoh launch (August, 1991) gave us the first solar soft\nX-ray telescope equipped with a CCD camera: SXT. Although SXT's\nangular resolution is comparable to the Skylab telescopes, its\nperformance is quite uniform over the entire sun, it has much\nlower scattered light, much more telemetry, and most\nimportantly, the CCD itself. Such a detector is inherently\nlinear and stable, and (much to our pleasure) robust; it is\nstill going strong ten years later. Almost each day its images\nbring new thrills, especially since Yohkoh has survived into its\nsecond solar maximum.

        skos:definition  "The MSG system has been outlined to support additional or research missions. ESA selected the Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget (GERB) instrument for flight on the MSG-1 satellite. The GERB instrument is developed by a European consortium led by the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL), United Kingdom, under a cooperation between the UK, Italy and Belgium. The EUMETSAT Council decided in November 1998 to fund the flight of two additional GERB instruments on MSG-2 and MSG-3.\n The first images from the GERB instrument flying on Meteosat-8  (MSG-1) were taken on 12 December 2002. \n\nThe principle objective of the GERB mission is to measure the Earth radiation budget, in support of climate research and monitoring. A GERB International Science Team (GIST) had been established and tasked inter alia to define the science requirements, products and processing algorithms, and to implement science and validation activities. The consortium that developed and is responsible for operating the GERB system includes the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL), UK; Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine (ICSTM), UK; Hadley Centre, UK; Leicester University, UK; RMI, Belgium; Advanced Mechanical and Optical Systems Ltd (AMOS Ltd), Belgium; and Officine Galileo, Italy. \n\nThe Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium (RMI) was a key player in the development of the GERB concept, and Belgium provides half of the GERB ground segment infrastructure and services.\n\nThe GERB instrument, as part of the satellite, is operated by EUMETSAT in coordination with the GERB Operations Team based at ICSTM.GERB data are received at the EUMETSAT ground segment and passed to the GERB ground segment for data processing. The data and products are then distributed by RAL to centres throughout Europe which use the information to evaluate and improve climate monitoring and Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models.\n\nThe GERB instrument is a scanning radiometer with two broadband channels, one covering the solar spectrum (0.32 to 4.0 µm), the other covering a wider portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (0.32 to 30 µm).  Together these channels are used to derive the thermal radiation emitted by the Earth in the spectral range 4.0 to 30 µm. Data are calibrated on board in order to support the retrieval of radiative fluxes of reflected solar radiation and emitted thermal radiation at the top of the atmosphere with an accuracy of 1%. The radiation budget represents the balance between incoming energy from the Sun and outgoing thermal (longwave) and reflected (shortwave) energy from the Earth.\n\nThe GERB broadband channels span the twelve much narrower channels measured by the MSGs other instrument  the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI). Thus GERB fills in the gaps in the thermal radiation spectrum missed by the SEVIRI channels. However, the GERB measures the thermal radiation at a coarser spatial resolution. Back on the ground, RMI scientists use the finer spatial resolution of the SEVIRI data to improve the spatial resolution of the GERB images. \n\nSource: EUMETSAT\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: GERB\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Imaging Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Short_Name: GERB\n      Long_Name: Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget\n   End_Group\n   Group: Instrument_Associated_Sensors\n      Short_Name: GERB\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: METEOSAT\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Ultraviolet\n      Number_Channels: 2 broadband channels, one covering the solar spectrum (0.32 to 4.0 µm), the other covering a wider portion of the electromagnetic spectrum (0.32 to 30 µm).\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 4.0 - 30 µm\n      Spectral_Frequency_Resolution: With and without quartz filter: 0.32  - 4.0 µm, 0.32 - 30 µm\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bullet111/chapter5_bul111.pdf\n   Online_Resource: http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/spat/research/missions/atmos_missions/gerb/instrument\n   Online_Resource: http://badc.nerc.ac.uk/view/badc.nerc.ac.uk__ATOM__dataent_gerb\n   Sample_Image: http://radagast.nerc-essc.ac.uk/Assets/GERB_schematic.gif\n   Creation_Date: 2007-09-14\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Data_Rate: 50.6 Kbits/sec (L Band)\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 2002-12-12\n      Instrument_Owner: European consortium led by the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL), United Kingdom, under a cooperation between the UK, Italy and Belgium.\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

Spectra are only saved if the ion peak in\nthe spectrum is above a threshold level. Background spectra\nwere determined and flagged. Particle size scans were initiated\nperiodically and each size was sampled until 30 particle hits\nwere obtained, unless the sampling time became\nexcessive. Aerodynamic particle sizes ranged from about 40 to\n1300 nm and were partitioned into nine discrete size classes\nlogarithmically spaced, roughly, over the range.

        skos:definition  "[Source: National Space Science Data Center, http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1976-091A-03 ]\n\nThe purpose of the GFE-3R dosimeter was to measure the radiation dose in silicon under aluminum shielding of four thicknesses representative of Block 5D DMSP spacecraft. The dosimeter, built by the Aerospace Corporation Space Science Laboratory, consisted of four separate, single-detector units. These omnidirectional sensors were small, cubical, lithium-drifted, silicon detectors centered under hemispherical shells, and heavily shielded (relative to the hemispherical shell) over the rear 2 pi solid angle. The shielding domes for the four sensors were 35, 75, 125, and 200 mils of aluminum, respectively. The dosimeter directly measured the ionization in the silicon cube caused by the natural radiation and served as an electron-proton spectrometer, thus yielding the fluences of energetic electrons and protons encountered in the DMSP orbit, as a function of time. Four integral discriminators, with thresholds corresponding to deposited energy of 25, 75, 300, and 5000 keV, were used to analyze the pulse-height spectrum of signals produced by protons, electrons, and gamma rays entering the detector. Individual pulses from the 25, 300, and 5000 keV channels were counted in scaling registers, which are read out and reset by the telemetry system every three s. Pulses, whose amplitudes exceed the gating thresholds of 25 keV and 75 keV, were integrated into 1 MeV equivalent energy pulses (corresponding to a dose of 8.0E-6 rad), which were counted by a cumulative storage register. These registers were read out every three seconds but not reset by the telemetry so that the number of counts read out at any time represented the total energy in MeV deposited in the silicon acitve volume during the mission life. Maximum accumulated dose storage corresponded to 5.5E5 rads. Additional information can be obtained from Aerospace Corporation publication number TOR-0077(1630)-1, June 1977.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: GFE-3R DOSIMETER\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Thermal/Radiation Detectors\n      Short_Name: GFE-3R DOSIMETER\n      Long_Name: Radiation Dosimeter (SSJ*)\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: DMSP 5D-1/F1\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1976-091A-03\n   Creation_Date: 2008-09-25\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: Department of Defense-Department of the Air Force (United States)\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "Data acquired from the TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) are used to produce atmospheric soundings.  The TOVS software transforms upwelling infrared and microwave radiant energy into vertical temperature and water vapor profiles.  A variety of other parameters, such as total ozone, cloud height and amount, and tropopause temperature and pressure, are also derived.  Approximately 50,000 soundings, spaced 80 to 300 km apart, are produced daily by two polar orbiting satellites.  Objective analysis and noise screening techniques that eliminate bad, redundant, and questionable data reduce this to about 10,000 soundings per day.\n\n\nTOVS, as flown aboard the Advanced TIROS-N (ATN) is a three instrument system consisting of the HIRS/2, SSU and MSU. \n\nThe High-resolution Infrared Sounder (HIRS/2) is a 20 channel instrument for taking atmospheric measurements, primarily in the IR region.  The data acquired can be used to compute atmospheric temperatures from the Earth surface to 50 mb, water vapor content in three atmospheric layers, and the total ozone content of the atmospheric column.  HIRS/2 will be replaced by an improved version onboard NOAA-K,L, and M in the 1990s.\n\n\nThe Stratospheric Sounding Unit (SSU) is a three channel instrument, provided by the United Kingdom, that uses the selective absorption technique.  The pressure in a carbon dioxide gas cell in the optical path determines the spectral characteristics of each channel, and the mass of carbon dioxide in each cell determines the atmospheric level at which the weighting function of each channel peaks.  It will be replaced by an advanced passive microwave sensor in the 1990s.\n\nThe Microwave Sounding Unit (MSU) is a four channel Dicke radiometer making passive microwave measurements in the 5.5-mm oxygen band. Unlike infrared instruments of TOVS, the MSU is little influenced by clouds in the field of view.  An MSU is onboard NOAA-11, launched in 1988, and will be onboard NOAA-D in 1990, NOAA-I in 1991, and NOAA-J in 1992.  After that, the MSU will be replaced (on 'K', 'L', and 'M') by the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU).\n\n\nNote: For more information of these sensors, look under individual\nsensor entries for each instrument:\n\n\nHIGH RES.

        skos:definition  "The SOund SUrveillance System, or SOSUS, is a fixed component of the\nU.S. Navy's Integrated Undersea Surveillance Systems(IUSS) network\nused for deep ocean surveillance during the Cold War. Installation\nof SOSUS was begun in the mid 1950s by the U.S. Navy for use in\nantisubmarine warfare. SOSUS consists of bottom mounted hydrophone\narrays connected by undersea communication cables to facilities on\nshore. The individual arrays are installed primarily on continental\nslopes and seamounts at locations optimized for undistorted long range\nacoustic propagation. The combination of location within the oceanic\nsound channel and the sensitivity of large-aperture arrays allows the\nsystem to detect radiated acoustic power of less than a watt at ranges\nof several hundred kilometers. In October, 1990, the Navy granted\napproval to NOAA/PMEL to access the SOSUS arrays in the North Pacific\nto assess their value in ocean environmental monitoring,as part of the\nU.S. government's dual-use initiative.\n\nThe data collection systems developed by NOAA's VENTS Program have\nbeen in place since August 29, 1991. Acoustic signals from the north\nPacific Ocean are monitored and recorded at the Newport, Oregon facility\nof NOAA/PMEL. This is the primary tool for both continuous monitoring of\nlow-level seismicity around the northeast Pacific Ocean and real-time\ndetection of volcanic activity along the northeast Pacific spreading\ncenters in support of the VENTS research program in ocean hydrothermal\nsystems. Real-time ridge crest monitoring potentially permits the timely\non-site investigation of hydrothermal and magmatic emissions.\n\nData acquisition is accomplished by combining portions of the Navy's\nprocessing facilities with NOAA-designed systems installed at the U.S.\nNaval Ocean Processing Facility (NOPF) at Whidbey Island, Washington.\nAnalog outputs from each hydrophone element are available either through\ndirect cabling or remote data linkage. Navy systems perform adaptive beam\nforming on digitized hydrophone signals, with the outputs converted back to\nanalog electrical signals. These analog hydrophone and beam-former outputs\nare accessed by the NOAA-supplied systems, where the signals are low-pass\nfiltered, digitized, and temporarily buffered on hard disk. The digital\ndata are provided to a wide-area network (WAN) based on Network File System\n(NFS) protocol, linking (by encrypted, dedicated telephone line) the\nacquisition computer to an analysis system located at NOAA laboratories in\nNewport, Oregon.\n\nFor more information on U.S. Navy SOund SUrveillance System (SOSUS)see:\n\"http://newport.pmel.noaa.gov/geophysics/sosus_system.html\"\n\nAddress inquiries to:\nChris Fox - Principal Investigator\nNOAA/PMEL\nOSU Hatfield Marine Science Center\n2115 S.E.

        skos:definition  "The TOMS instrument is a second-generation backscatter ultraviolet ozone sounder. TOMS can measure \"total column ozone\"--the total amount of ozone in a \"column\" of air from the Earth's surface to the top of the atmosphere--under all daytime observing and geophysical conditions. TOMS observations cover the near ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, where sunlight is absorbed only partially by ozone.\n\nTOMS/EP measures total ozone by observing both incoming solar energy and backscattered ultraviolet (UV) radiation at six wavelengths. \"Backscattered\" radiation is solar radiation that has penetrated to the Earth's lower atmosphere and is then scattered by air molecules and clouds back through the stratosphere to the satellite sensors. Along that path, a fraction of the UV is absorbed by ozone. By comparing the amount of backscattered radiation to observations of incoming solar energy at identical wavelengths, scientists can calculate the Earth's albedo, the ratio of light reflected by Earth compared to that it receives. Changes in albedo at the selected wavelengths can be used to derive the amount of ozone above the surface.\n\nThe Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data represent the primary long-term, continuous record of satellite-based observations available for use in monitoring global and regional trends in total ozone over the past 25 years. TOMS also provides measurements of tropospheric aerosols, volcanic SO2, ultraviolet irradiance, erythemal UV exposure, and effective reflectivity from the Earth's surface and clouds. The data are produced by the Laboratory for Atmospheres at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.\n\nFour TOMS instruments have been successfully flown in orbit – aboard the Nimbus-7 (Nov. 1978 - May 1993), Meteor-3 (Aug. 1991 - Dec. 1994), Earth Probe (July 1996 - current), and ADEOS (Sep. 1996 - June 1997) satellites.

        skos:definition  "A strain meter is an instrument used by geophysicists to measure the deformation of the Earth. Linear strain meters measure the changes in the distance between two points, using either a solid piece of material (over a short distance) or a laser interferometer (over a long distance, up to several hundred meters). The type using a solid length standard was invented by Benioff in 1932, using an iron pipe; later instruments used rods made of fused quartz. Modern instruments of this type can make measurements of length changes over very small distances, and are commonly placed in boreholes to measure small changes in the diameter of the borehole. Another type of borehole instrument detects changes in a volume filled with fluid (such as silicone oil). The most common type is the dilatometer invented by Sacks and Evertson in the USA (patent 3,635,076); a design that uses specially shaped volumes to measure the strain tensor has been developed by Sakata in Japan.\n[Source: Wikipedia ]\n\nAll these types of strain meters can measure deformation over frequencies from a few Hz to periods of days, months, and years. This allows them to measure signals at lower frequencies than can be detected with seismometers. Most strain meter records show signals from the earth tides, and seismic waves from earthquakes. At longer periods, they can also record the gradual accumulation of stress (physics) caused by plate tectonics, the release of this stress in earthquakes, and rapid changes of stress following earthquakes.\n\nThe most extensive network of strain meters is installed in Japan; it includes mostly quartz-bar instruments in tunnels and borehole strain meters, with a few laser instruments. Starting in 2003 there has been a major effort (the Plate Boundary Observatory) to install many more strain meters along the Pacific/North-America plate boundary in the United States. The aim is to install about 100 borehole strain meters, primarily in Washington, Oregon and California, and five laser strain meters, all in California.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: STRAIN METER\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: In Situ/Laboratory Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Pressure/Height Meters\n      Short_Name: STRAIN METER\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: FIELD INVESTIGATION\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strainmeter\n   Sample_Image: http://www.techbriefs.com/images/stories/features/2007/appbrief_1207a.png\n   Creation_Date: 2009-04-23\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "The SupraThermal Ion Composition Spectrometer (STICS), part of the SMS Package \non WIND is designed to measure the mass and mass/charge of suprathermal ions.\nIt is similar to SWICS in that it employs electrostatic deflection,\ntime-of-flight and residual energy measurements. The electrostatic deflection\nsystem covers a range of 6 to 223 keV/e in 30 logarithmic steps (1 step per\nrotation of the spacecraft). An ion experiences no post acceleration prior to\nentering the time-of-flight chamber. The ion?s time- of-flight (TOF) is\ncalculated from start and stop pulses created by the collection of scattered\nelectrons by microchannel plates at the beginning and end of the ion?s flight\npath. These scattered electrons are generated when the ion passes through a\nthin carbon foil at the entrance of the chamber and when it impinges on the\nsolid state detector at the end. The solid state detector also measures the\nresidual energy (Emeas) of the ion.\n\nFor more information, see:\nhttp://space.umd.edu/wind/sms.html\n"@en ;

The two-channel\nscanning radiometer operated in a 250-MHz band centered at 37\nGHz. One channel was used to measure the vertical polarization\nand the other measured the horizontal polarization. The antenna\nbeam array, a 90- by 20- by 12-cm box-like structure, was\nmounted on top of the spacecraft sensory ring and was pointed in\nthe direction of the spacecraft's forward motion and tilted down\n45 deg from the satellite antenna axis. The antenna beam scanned\nthe earth in 71 discrete steps for various angles extending up\nto 35 deg on either side of the orbital plane. The deduced\nbrightness temperatures were expected to be accurate to within\n3-5 deg K. Spatial resolution was 20 km in the cross-track\ndirection and 45 km in the direction parallel to the subpoint\ntrack. For a more detailed description, see Section 5 of \"The\nNimbus 6 User's Guide\" (TRF B23261), available from NSSDC. The\nESMR performance was satisfactory until September 15, 1976, when\nthe horizontal channel output was zero due to a failure of the\nFerrite-Dicke switch.

        skos:definition  "The Wide Band Data instrumentation (WBD) on the Cluster-II spacecraft is part\nof the WEC consortium of wave experiments and consists of a digital wideband\nreceiver which can provide electric or magnetic field waveforms over a wide\nrange of frequencies up to 577 kHz.\n\nThe wideband technique involves transmitting band-limited waveforms directly to\nthe ground using a high-rate data link. The primary advantage of this approach\nis that continuous waveforms are available for detailed high-resolution\nfrequency-time analysis. \n\nThe instrument processes signals from one of four sensors which can be chosen\nvia command. The four selectable inputs consist of two electric antennas (Ey,\nEz) provided by the EFW investigation, and two magnetic search coils (Bx , By )\nprovided by the STAFF investigation. Primarily, WBD will utilise the electric\nantennas.\n\nThe input frequency range of the wideband receiver can be shifted by a\nfrequency converter to any one of four ranges (0, 125 ,250, or 500 kHz), where\nthe conversion frequency determines the lower edge of the frequency range to be\nreceived.\n\nThe bandwidth of the WBD instrument's output waveform is determined by one of\nthree bandpass filters (9.5, 19, or 77 kHz) selected in combination with a\ngiven output mode. The output waveform is sampled by an 8-bit\nanalogue-to-digital converter which provides the sampling resolution and data\noutput rates listed in Table 33. For sample rates where the bit rate exceeds\nthe spacecraft telemetry data rate (220 kbit/s), the digitised wideband data\nare buffered by the format generator and read out at a reduced average bit rate\nof 220 kbits/sec. The format generator organises the digitised waveform data\ninto a 1096-byte output frame, which includes appropriate timing and status\ninformation.\n\nThe WBD instrument utilises two separate telemetry acquisition modes for\ntransferring frames of digitised data to the spacecraft data handling system.\nThe primary mode (TDA 8) supports real-time acquisition of WBD data by the NASA\nDSN. The second data mode (TDA 5.2) supports burst data acquisition through the\nWEC DWP onto an onboard Solid State Recorder. In this second mode, DWP reduces\nthe WBD data rate (and bandwidth) by a factor of 3 via digital filtering.\n\nThe WBD instruments were designed and built at The University of Iowa through\nfunding provided by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. \nSee:\nhttp://www-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/plasma-wave/istp/cluster/\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: WBD\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Solar/Space Observing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Magnetic Field/Electric Field Instruments\n      Short_Name: WBD\n      Long_Name: Wide Band Data Instrument\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: CLUSTER-II\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/plasma-wave/istp/cluster/\n   Sample_Image: http://sci.esa.int/science-e-media/img/36/hires_36662.JPG\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Data_Rate: 73 kbps\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 2000-07-16\n      Instrument_Owner: University of Iowa\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

In the case of the SASS, the\nmain interest was in measuring the ocean surface backscatter as a means to\nderive the surface wind vector.  The physical basis for this technique is that\nthe strength of the radar backscatter is proportional to the amplitude of the\nsurface capillary waves (Bragg scattering), which in turn is related the wind\nspeed near the surface.  Moreover, the radar backscatter is anisotropic,\nallowing the wind direction to be derived from backscatter measurements at\ndifferent azimuth angles. In practice, however, there was normally a fourfold\nambiguity in the wind direction that had to be resolved  manually.\nThe SASS operated at a frequency of 14.6 GHz (or 2.0 cm).  It incorporated four\ndual-polarized fan beam antennas, two radiating +/- 45 degrees forward and two,\n+/- 45 degrees aft, which produced an X-shaped pattern of illumination on the\nsurface.\nGlobal measurements of the surface wind velocity over the seas were obtained\nfrom SASS at least once every 36 hours with the high latitudes being covered\nmore frequently.  The resolution of the instrument was 50 km and the grid\nspacing of the output data product, 100 km.\n___________\nTaken from:\nElachi,C., 'Microwave and Infrared Satellite Remote Sensors,' in MANUAL OF\nREMOTE SENSING, edited by R.N.Colwell, pp 571-650, American Society of\nPhotogrammetry, Sheridan Press, Falls Church, Virginia, 1983.

        skos:definition  "\nThe Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE), flown on the Earth\nRadiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) and the NOAA Polar Orbiting\nEnvironmental Satellites (NOAA-9, NOAA-10), was designed to measure the\nenergy exchange between the earth-atmosphere system and space.  The\nmeasurements of global, zonal, and regional radiation budgets on\nmonthly time scales helped in climate prediction and in the\ndevelopment of statistical relationships between regional weather and\nradiation budget anomalies. The ERBE consisted of two seperate\ninstrument packages: the nonscanner (ERBE-NS) instrument and the\nscanner (ERBS-S) instrument. The ERBE-NS instrument had five sensors,\neach using cavity radiometer detectors. Four of them were primarily\nearth-viewing. Two wide-field-of-view (WFOV) sensors viewed the entire\ndisk of the earth from limb to limb, approximately 135 deg. Two medium\nFOV (MFOV) sensors viewed a 10-deg region. The fifth sensor was a\nsolar monitor that measured the total radiation from the sun. Of the\nfour earth-viewing sensors, one WFOV and one MFOV sensor made total\nradiation measurements; the other two measured reflected solar\nradiation in the shortwave spectral band between 0.2 and 5 micrometers\nby using Suprasil-W filters. The earth-emitted longwave radiation\ncomponent was determined by subtracting the shortwave measurement from\nthe total measurement. The ERBE-S instrument was a scanning radiometer\nthat contained three narrow FOV channels. One channel measured\nreflected solar radiation in the shortwave spectral interval between\n0.2 and 5 micrometers. Another channel measured earth-emitted\nradiation in the longwave spectral region from 5 to 50 micrometers.\nThe third channel measured total radiation with a wavelength between\n0.2 and 50 micrometers. All three channels were located within a\ncontinuously rotating scan drum, which scanned the FOV across track\nsequentially from horizon to horizon. Each channel made 74 radiometric\nmeasurements during each scan, and the FOV of each channel was 3 by\n4.5 deg, which covered about 40 km at the earth's surface.  The ERBE-S\nalso viewed the sun for calibration.\nAdditional information can be obtained from the \"Earth Radiation\nBudget Experiment (ERBE): An Overview,\" J.

        skos:definition  "Accelerometers are sensors and instruments for measuring, displaying and analyzing acceleration and vibration. They can be used on a stand-alone basis, or in conjunction with a data acquisition system. Accelerometers are available in many forms. They can be raw sensing elements, packaged transducers, or as a sensor system or instrument, incorporating features such as totalizing, local or remote display and data recording. Accelerometers can have from one axis to three axes of measurement, the multiple axes typically being orthogonal to each other. These devices work on many operating principles. The most common types of accelerometers are piezoelectric, capacitance, null-balance, strain gage, resonance, piezoresistive and magnetic induction. \n\nThree main features must be considered when selecting accelerometers: amplitude range, frequency range, and ambient conditions. Acceleration amplitude range is measured in Gs, whereas frequency is measured in Hz. For the ambient conditions, such things as temperature should be considered, as well as the maximum shock and vibration the accelerometers will be able to handle. This is the rating of how much abuse the device can stand before it stops performing, much different from how much vibration or acceleration accelerometers can measure.\n\nElectrical output options depend on the system being used with the accelerometers. Common analog options are voltage, current or frequency. Digital output choices are the standard parallel and serial signals. Another option is to use accelerometers with an output of a change in state of switches or alarms.\n\nWhen mounting accelerometers, many choices must be weighed based on application and ability. Probably the most secure method is stud mounting. Many accelerometers have the option of a threaded section that can be fastened to the machinery or object being monitored. For applications where this is not possible or desirable, many other options are available: wax, magnets and adhesive. Some applications require accelerometers to be mounted on an electrically isolated surface to provide ground isolation between the mounting surface and signals from the accelerometers. Triaxial mounting cubes can also be purchased to mount three accelerometers together in an orthogonal configuration to each other. This way, only one mounting surface on the monitored device has to be used for all three.\n To minimize frequency response errors, care must be taken to relieve cable strain by securing the cables attached to accelerometers. To do this, affix the cables to the same device the accelerometers are attached to. This will prevent flexing of the cables between the anchor point and the vibrating surface, thus keeping the accuracy of the readings as high as possible.\n\n[Summary provided by 1999-2003 GlobalSpec Inc.]\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: ACCELEROMETERS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: In Situ/Laboratory Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Magnetic/Motion Sensors\n      Instrument_Type: Accelerometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: ACCELEROMETERS\n      Short_Name: ACCELEROMETERS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: UND CITATION II\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

Sixteen of the cube corners were tilted away from the axis of the ring by an angle of 25 deg and the remaining 80 cubes by an angle of 50 deg. Because of the great distance of the array from the center of mass of the satellite the range correction varied from -5.28 m at zenith to -3.08 m near the horizon. When illuminated by laser light pulses from the ground, each retroreflector cube in the array reflected the light pulses back to a telescope/receiver on the ground. A digital counter recorded the time of flight of the laser light pulses from the ground to the satellite and back to the ground. Range was determined from this time.

        skos:definition  "[Source: NASA CloudSat home page]\n\nThe Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) is a 94-GHz nadir-looking radar which measures the power backscattered by clouds as a function of distance from the radar. The CPR was developed jointly by NASA/JPL and the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). The overall design of the CPR is simple, well understood, and has strong heritage from many cloud radars already in operation in ground-based and airborne applications. Most of the design parameters and subsystem configurations are nearly identical to those for the Airborne Cloud Radar, which has been flying on the NASA DC-8 aircraft since 1998.\n\nThe design of the CPR is driven by the science objectives. The original requirements on CPR were: sensitivity defined by a minimum detectable reflectivity factor of -30 dBZ, along-track sampling of 2 km, a dynamic range of 70 dB, 500 m vertical resolution and calibration accuracy of 1.5 dB. The minimum detectable reflectivity factor requirement was reduced to -26 dBZ when the mission was changed to put CloudSat into a higher orbit for formation flying.\n\nTo achieve sufficient cloud detection sensitivity, a relatively low frequency (i.e. <94 GHz) radar would require an enormous antenna and high peak power. At frequencies much greater than 100 GHz, a large antenna and high peak power are also needed due to rapid signal attenuation through cloud absorption. Furthermore, technologies at such high frequencies are less well developed. The 94-GHz frequency chosen by CPR offers the best compromise, meeting performance within the spacecraft resources. In fact, most existing airborne cloud radars operate at 94 GHz. These airborne radars provide extensive heritage for CPR on instrument design and technology, data processing, and retrieval algorithms. A primary frequency allocation of 94 GHz for spaceborne cloud radar sensing has been formally approved at the 1997 World Radio Conference.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: CLOUDSAT-CPR\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Active Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Radar Spectrometers\n      Short_Name: CLOUDSAT-CPR\n      Long_Name: CLOUDSAT CLOUD PROFILING RADAR\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: CLOUDSAT\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: RADIO\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 94 GHz\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://cloudsat.atmos.colostate.edu/instrument\n   Sample_Image: http://www.sti.nasa.gov/tto/Spinoff2006/images/p110-125_img_8.jpg\n   Creation_Date: 2007-05-22\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Data_Rate: 15 kbps\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "Airborne Chromatograph For Atmospheric Trace Species (ACATS) is designed to measure a variety of organic chlorine and long-lived species in the stratosphere and upper troposphere. The instrument includes four separate gas chromatographic (GC) channels each incorporating an electron capture detector. Channels can be configured by selecting different GC columns to measure the following combination of individual trace gas species: CFC-11 and CFC-113; CH3CCl3 (MC) and CCl4 (CT); CFC-12 and N2O; or HCFC-22, CH3Cl, or hydrogen, methane and carbon monoxide. The gas chromatograph can measure one sample every 2-3 minutes with a detection limit of 2% of the maximum tropospheric value. The absolute accuracy of the measurement is +/- 3% plus precision.\n\nThis research is supported by the High Speed Research Program (HSRP) of NASA and the Atmospheric Chemistry Project of NOAA's Global Climate Change Program.\n\nAdditional information available at the ACATS Home Page:\nhttp://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/hats/airborne/acats/\n\n[Summary provided by NOAA]\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: ACATS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: In Situ/Laboratory Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Chemical Meters/Analyzers\n      Short_Name: ACATS\n      Long_Name: Airborne Chromatograph for Atmospheric Trace Species\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: NASA WB-57F\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/hats/airborne/acats/\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "There are three scientific objectives to be studied by the HEP investigation on\nGeotail: (1) plasma dynamics in the geomagnetic tail, (2) solar flare particle\nacceleration and propagation, and (3) the origin, lifetime and propagation of\ncosmic ray particles. There are five instruments that make up this\ninvestigation: Low-energy particle Detector (LD), Burst Detector (BD),\nMedium-energy Isotope detectors (MI-1 and MI-2), and High energy Isotope\ndetector (HI).\n\nLD and BD are mainly dedicated to magnetospheric studies.\n\nMI and HI concentrate on solar flare and cosmic ray studies.\n\nThe LD sensor system consists of three identical Imaging Ion Mass spectrometers\nwhich use time-of-flight/energy measurement, and covers 180 degrees in polar\nangle over the energy range 20--300 keV for electrons, 2 keV--1.5 MeV for\nprotons, and 2 keV--1.5 MeV per charge for ions. LD provides distribution of\nelectrons and ions with complete coverage of the unit sphere in phase space,\nand electron and proton flux in 4 azimuth sectors, helium and oxygen flux at an\nazimuth of 0 degrees.\n\nThe BD sensor consists of three delta-E x E telescopes which identify particles\nby their energy loss and residual energy over the energy range 0.12--2.5 MeV\nfor electrons, 0.7--35 MeV for protons, and 0.7--140 MeV for helium. The three\ntelescopes each have an opening angle of 30 degrees by 45 degrees with look\ndirections of 30, 90, and 150 degrees to the spin axis. BD provides count rates\nfor high energy electrons, protons and helium, as well as electron and proton\nfluxes in four 90 degree azimuth bins.\n\nThe MI and HI instruments are all silicon semiconductor detector telescopes\nutilizing the well-known dE/dx x E algorithm for isotope identification: mass\nand nuclear charge. The MI instrument measures elemental and isotopic\ncompositions of solar energetic particles and energetic particles in the\nheliosphere with 2&ltZ&lt28 in the 2.4--80 MeV/nucleon energy range , and\nmeasures the elemental composition of solar energetic particles heavier than\niron. The HI instrument also measures elemental and isotopic compositions of\nsolar energetic particles and galactic cosmic rays with 2&ltZ&lt28 in the\n10-210 MeV/nucleon energy range.\n\nHEP operates continuously with no change in allocated bit rate. LD has two\noperational modes: normal and burst. Burst mode is an internal high speed mode\nwhich does not change the data output.\n\nBD has four operational modes for calculating energy spectra for electrons,\nprotons, and helium: 16 sectors in 1 spin (time high resolution mode), 8\nsectors in 32 spins (energy high resolution mode), 8 sectors in 2 spins, and 16\nsectors in 4 spins. MI and HI have only one operational mode.\n\nPrincipal Investigator:\nProf. Tadayoshi Doke\nWaseda University\ne-mail: jkikuchi@cfi.waseda.ac.jp\n\nSee:\nhttp://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/geotail_inst.shtml\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: HEP\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Solar/Space Observing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Particle Detectors\n      Short_Name: HEP\n      Long_Name: High Energy Particles (Geotail)\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: GEOTAIL\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/geotail_inst.shtml#HEP\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/database/MasterCatalog?sc=1992-044A&ex=1\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Data_Rate: 1.664 kbps\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 1992-07-24\n      Instrument_Owner: Waseda University, Japan\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "\nThe AERI instrument is an advanced version of the high spectral\nresolution interferometer sounder (HIS) designed and fabricated\nat the University of Wisconsin (Revercomb et al. 1988) to\nmeasure upwelling infrared radiances from an aircraft. The AERI\nis a fully automated ground-based passive infrared\ninterferometer that measures downwelling atmospheric radiance\nfrom 3.3 - 18.2 mm (550 - 3000 cm-1) at less than 10-minute\ntemporal resolution with a spectral resolution of one\nwavenumber. Careful attention to calibration results in an\nabsolute calibration accuracy of better than 1% of the\nambient. The AERI instrument foreoptics consist of a scene\nmirror and two calibration blackbodies. These blackbodies are\nessential to provide a well known stable hot and ambient\ntemperature reference for calibration of the downwelling skyview\nradiances. A typical measurement cycle consists of a\nthree-minute sky dwell period followed by two-minute dwell\nperiods for each of the blackbodies. While the interferometer\nacquires an uncalibrated spectrum every two seconds, averaging\nreduces the radiometric noise in the measurements. The\ntemperature of one of the blackbodies is fixed at 60 oC, while\nthe other fluctuates with the ambient temperature.\n\nMore Information and data: \"http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/aeri/\"\n\n[Extracted from the AERI Homepage]\n"@en ;

In a fixed\nsystem, the laser is permanently located at a pier or foundation that\ndoes not change position.\n\nThe movable systems are different. NASA operates four stations\nknown as Mobile Laser Ranging Systems (MOBLAS), in movable\nlocations. MOBLAS usually consist of two trailer vans which can be\ndriven to a given observing location and set up for an observing\nsession that will then last for months or years at that site. Because\nof the time-consuming setup and breakdown process, these movable\nsystems are rarely moved. The MOBLAS at Goddard is one of three\nNASA SLR's located in North America. The fourth is in Yarragadee,\nAustralia.\n\nFour of the NASA stations are the highly-mobile type called\nTransportable Laser Ranging Systems (TLRS). They are newer\nsystems which are smaller versions of the fixed and movable\nSLR systems. They are complete systems able to operate from a pad\naccessible by road, and require relatively short setup and breakdown\ntimes. Because of the need to sample the orbit of the retroreflector\nsatellite, however, the duration of recording is generally measured in\nterms of weeks to months. These have been placed in locations such\nas Chile, French Polynesia, Peru and several sites in North America,\nMexico and Europe.\n\nThe other two NASA systems are fixed systems located in Texas and\nHawaii and are operated for NASA by local universities.\n\n[Summary provided by NASA]\n\n"@en ;

These data can be used to clear the view. The AC on EO-1 will be the first use of a dedicated instrument to per- form this function on a real-time basis. This instrument will provide scientific return both in terms of improved imagery and hyperspectral sensing capabilities. It will also test a number of new technologies. Because the AC is small and adaptable to different spacecraft configurations, it is a bolt-on instrument, which can be attached to any future Earth imaging spacecraft. The LEISA AC instrument was developed by Goddard's Applied Engineering and Technology Directorate (AETD).

The NSCAT\ninstrument is intended to be a follow-on to the Seasat-1 scatterometer\n(SASS) flown in 1978. The NSCAT is designed to measure the ocean\nsurface wind velocity and will provide data on air-sea interactions,\ncalculations for large-scale fluxes between atmosphere and ocean,\nair-sea coupling and interannual variability of the Earth's climate.\nThe NSCAT was a 13.995 GHz (Ku-band) active microwave radar that\ntransmits continuous pulses to the ocean surface and will receive\nbackscattered radiation from the Earth. The radar cross section of the\nsurface is used to derive the backscattered radiation as a function of\nboth wind speed and direction and to determine the wind vector. The\nNSCAT consists of three major subsystems: the Radio Frequency\nSubsystem (RFS), the antenna subsystem, and the Digital Data Subsystem\n(DSS). Transmittted pulses at 13.995 GHz are generated by the RFS to\neach antenna beam. A low-noise amplifier of 3 dB was used to amplify\nthe return echo. The antenna subsystem consisted of 6 identical,\ndual-polarization fan beam antennas, approximately 10 feet long.  The\nsix antennas were calibrated to 0.25 dB prior to launch. The NSCAT\nwill be the first spaceborne scatterometer to employ on-board digital\nprocessing of the Doppler-shifted signal. The NSCAT measures two\nswaths, each 600 km wide at nadir and radar cross sections in three\nazimuth angles for a wind speed accuracy of 2 meter/sec and direction\naccuracy of 20 degrees and a spatial resolution of 25 km. NSCAT data\nis processed to science products directly from telemetry by the NSCAT\nData Processing and Instrument Operations (DP&IO).

The AVCS cameras were mounted on the satellite sensory ring, facing earthward and deployed in a fan-like array to produce a three-segment composite picture. Each camera covered a 37-deg field of view with the center camera pointing straight down. The optical axes of the other two cameras were directed 35 deg to either side. Each of the cameras employed an f/4 lens with a focal length of 16.5 mm. A potentiometer attached to the solar array controlled the lens opening from f/16 when the spacecraft was over the equator to f/4 when it was near the poles. The 800-scan-line, 2.54-cm-diameter vidicon pickup tubes yielded a linear resolution of better than 1 km at nadir from an altitude of 800 km. At this altitude, the camera array produced a composite picture covering an area of 830 by 2700 km. Up to 192 pictures (two full orbits of data) or 64 pictures per camera could be stored on tape for subsequent playback to an acquisition station. Using a transmission frequency of 1707.5 MHz, the two orbits of pictures could be telemetered to a ground station in 4 min. The AVCS experiment was highly successful. It provided the first near-global, high-resolution cloudcover pictures ever assembled and confirmed the decision to use this particular camera assembly as a basis for the first operational satellite system TOS/ESSA (TIROS Operational System/Environmental Science Services Administration). Data from this experiment can be obtained through SDSD.

The AOLFL measures a variety\nof reflected and induced light properties, from which a number of\noceanographic surface water properties can be derived.  These properties\ninclude ocean color and phytoplankton pigment concentrations.\nThe primary AOLFL sensor is a dual wavelength laser fluorospectrometer.\nThis sensor transmits two laser wavelengths, one UV (355nm) and one green\n(532nm) to the ocean surface from the aircraft. These laser frequencies\ninteract with the water molecules, causing a shift in the laser frequency.\nThis Raman shift of the 355nm and 532 nm laser radiation allows\nnormalization of other light measurements to compensate for changes in\nwater clarity. If biological organisms containing chlorophyll and/or\nphycoerythrin are present in the water, the 532nm laser light is absorbed,\nand reemitted as particular bands of fluorescence. These fluorescent\nsignals can be normalized to the water Raman signal, and have been shown\nto agree well with shipboard measurements of the same pigments. The 355nm\nlaser radiation causes fluorescence of some of the dissolved organic\nmaterial in the water. The water Raman normalized of this dissolved\norganic material is labeled CDOM (chromophoric dissolved organic matter).\nThe AOLFL also carries several spectrometers which measure the downwelling\nsunlight incident on the top of the aircraft, and the reflected sunlight\nfrom the ocean surface. From these measurements, various algorithms can\ndetermine chlorophyll concentrations in the same manner as CZCS satellite.\nThe ability of the AOLFL sensors to make oceanographic optical component\nmeasurements by both laser fluorescence techiques and by reflected spectra\ntechniques allows the validity of each technique to be tested.\n\n[This sensor description was derived from the WWW pages of the Airborne\nOceanographic Lidar Laboratory, Observational Sciences Branch, Wallops\nFlight Facility, NASA.

        skos:definition  "The Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II (SAGE II) on the Earth\nRadiation Budget Satellite (ERBS) was a seven-channel sunphotometer\nwhich measured stratospheric aerosols, ozone, water vapor, and\nnitrogen dioxide during spacecraft sunrise and sunset. The SAGE II\nmission objectives were to (1) develop a long-term global climatology\nof stratospheric aerosol extinction, (2) monitor transient events\n(e.g. volcanic eruptions), (3) develop a high-altitude cloud climatology,\nand (4) provide stratospheric ozone, water vapor, and nitrogen dioxide\nconcentration profiles at 1 km vertical resolution. The SAGE II was a\ntwo-axis gimbaled system capable of rotating in azimuth. The sun was\nacquired when two azimuth sun sensors were activated and rotated in\nazimuth until SAGE II was pointed at the radiometric centroid of the\nsun. A scan mirror moved at fast rate of 3 deg/sec to acquire the sun.\nThe mirror scanned across the sun at a slow rate of 15 min/sec. When the\nlimb of the sun was reached, the servo mechanism reversed and scanned the\nsun again. The sunlight was reflected into a Cassegranian telescope and\nfocused on an aperature that defined a 0.5-minute elevation angle by 2.5\nminute azimuth angle instantaneous field-of-view (IFOV). The aperature was\nthe entrance slit to the spectrometer, which used a holographic grating and\nfilters to isolate the seven wavelength bands (0.385 to 1.02 micrometer).\nChannels 1,2,3,4, and 7 used neutral density filters and channels 2,5, and 6\nused bandpass filters. All seven channels were sampled within 1 ms at 64 Hz\nand digitized to a 12-bit word. The SAGE II instrument measured the solar\nirradiance during each spacecraft sunrise and sunset so that two profiles\nfrom specific locations above the Earth were obtained during each spacecraft\nrevolution. SAGE II made about 15 sunrise and sunset measurements each\nday, seperated by 24.5 degrees in longitude and slightly in latitude.\nThe maximum latitudes covered were 80 N to 80 S.\nFor more information see:\nhttp://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/project/sage2/table_sage2.html\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: SAGE II\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Spectrometers\n      Short_Name: SAGE II\n      Long_Name: Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/PAIS/SAGE.html\n   Online_Resource: http://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/PRODOCS/sage2/table_sage2.html\n   Online_Resource: http://data.giss.nasa.gov/sageii/\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "\nInstrument Description\n\nIn order to demonstrate the capabilities of polarimetry an instrument\nthat can make either ground-based, or aircraft measurements, the\nResearch Scanning Polarimeter (RSP) has been developed by SpecTIR\nCorporation. This instrument has similar functional capabilities to\nthe proposed EOSP satellite instrument. Currently data acquisition is\nperformed on a laptop, which is shown here and gives an indication of\nthe size of the instrument. The scientific requirements for the\npolarimetric measurements are satisfied by the RSP through its high\nmeasurement accuracy, the wide range of viewing angles measured and by\nsampling of the spectrum of reflected solar radiation over most of the\nradiatively significant range.  The RSP instrument uses a polarization\ncompensated scan mirror assembly to scan the fields of view of six\nboresighted, refractive telescopes through +/-600 from the normal with\nrespect to the instrument baseplate. The refractive telescopes are\npaired, with each pair making measurements in three spectral\nbands. One telescope in each pair makes simultaneous measurements of\nthe linear polarization components of the intensity in orthogonal\nplanes at 00 and 900 to the meridional plane of the instrument, while\nthe other telescope simultaneously measures equivalent intensities in\northogonal planes at 450 and 1350. This approach ensures that the\npolarization signal is not contaminated by uncorrelated spatial or\ntemporal scene intensity variations during the course of the\npolarization measurements, which could create false\npolarization. These measurements in each instantaneous field of view\nin a scan provide the simultaneous determination of the intensity, and\nthe degree and azimuth of linear polarization in all nine spectral\nbands.\n\n- More information: \"http://www.giss.nasa.gov/data/rsp_air/specs.html\"\n\n[Summary adapted from the NASA/GISS home page]\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "The objective of the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) spectrometer is to measure emitted and reflected infrared radiance in the atmospheric column to permit retrieval of tropospheric carbon monoxide (CO) profiles and total column methane. Observations of CO and methane will be used to study how these gases interact with the surface, ocean, and biomass systems. The MOPITT instrument is bases on the principle of correlation spectroscopy utilizing both pressure-modulated and length-modulated gas cells, with detectors at 2.3, 2.4, and 4.7 micrometer. Atmospheric profiles of CO are measured with the 4.7 micrometer detector. CO and methane are measured by the 2.4 and 2.3 micrometer channels, respectively, sense solar radiation reflected from the surface. The MOPITT is a scanning instrument with a field-of-view of 1.8 degrees (22-km footprint at nadir). The scan line consists of 28 pixels, each at 1.8 degree increments with a maximum scan angle of 25.2 degrees off-axis (swath width of 620-km). MOPITT data products are expected to include gridded retrievals of methane with a horizontal resolution of 120 km at 1 % accuracy and gridded CO soundings with 10 % accuracy in three vertical layers between 0 and 15 km.

        skos:definition  "[Text Source: Von Braun Center for Science & Innovation, http://www.vcsi.org/hirad.html ]\n\nThe Hurricane Imaging Radiometer (HIRAD) is an innovative technology development designed to provide the operational and research communities with hurricane intensity information that cannot be observed by other sensors. HIRAD will produce imagery of ocean surface wind speed and rain rate during strong wind and heavy rain hurricane conditions that hamper the observational capabilities of existing instruments. HIRAD ocean surface wind observations will significantly contribute to the low altitude wind information needed for the NOAA observational requirement for three-dimensional tropical cyclone wind profiles, identified by the NOAA Hurricane Forecast Improvement Project as a high priority need. \n\nHIRAD is a passive microwave remote sensor which incorporates the observing frequency range of the NOAA Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer (which is the only active or passive remote sensing technique that has successfully measured surface wind speeds and rain rates in tropical cyclones) and a unique, technologically advanced array antenna and other technologies successfully demonstrated by the NASA Instrument Incubator Program. HIRAD will be a compact, lightweight, low-power instrument with no moving parts that will produce wide-swath imagery from aircraft or spacecraft platforms.\n\nThe HIRAD development team includes scientific and engineering personnel from the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), NOAA’s Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory (AOML) Hurricane Research Division (HRD), the University of Alabama in Huntsville, the University of Central Florida, and the University of Michigan.  The Von Braun Center for Science & Innovation collaboration will capitalize on an initial NASA MSFC technology investment to finish the development of two critical subsystems and to test-fly the integrated aircraft instrument in partnership with NASA MSFC.  This partnership will expedite the overall development of the HIRAD ocean wind sensor as a prototype for a NOAA Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) component of the Global Earth Observing Systems of Systems (GOESS) for research and operational tropical cyclone applications. \n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: HIRAD\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Radiometers\n      Short_Name: HIRAD\n      Long_Name: Hurricane Imaging Radiometer\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: NASA WB-57F\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://hirad.nsstc.nasa.gov/\n   Online_Resource: http://www.vcsi.org/hirad.html\n   Online_Resource: http://www.sprl.umich.edu/projects/HIRad/\n   Online_Resource: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hurricanes/missions/grip/news/hirad.html\n   Creation_Date: 2011-10-03\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

Derived from the Poseidon-1 (ALT) altimeter on Topex/Poseidon, it measures sea level, wave heights and wind speed determined from the shape and strength of the radar-return pulse. The altimeter emits a radar beam that is reflected back to the antenna from the Earth's surface. Poseidon-2 operates at two frequencies (13.6 GHz in the Ku-band, 5.3 GHz in the C-band) to determine atmospheric electron content, which affects the radar signal path delay. These two frequencies also serve to measure the amount of rain in the atmosphere.\n\nPoseidon-2 was designed by Alcatel Space Industries (ASPI) for CNES Toulouse Space Center, and is essentially an improved version of the Poseidon-1 altimeter that flies on TOPEX/Poseidon. Poseidon-2 improves on Poseidon-1 by adding a second frequency at 5.3 GHz, changing to digital technology, and using a new more powerful rad-hard microprocessor.

        skos:definition  "The CBERS (China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite)cooperative program has been jointly developed by China and Brazil to build up a set of remote sensing Satellites.  CBERS-1 was launched on Oct. 14, 1999, which operated until Aug. 2003. CBERS-2 was launched on Oct. 21, 2003, which is still working in orbit. The third satellite CBERS-2B was launched on Sep.19, 2007, which carries in-board a multisensor payload with different spatial resolutions called: HR (High Resolution Panchromatic), CCD (Charge Coupled Device) and WFI (Wide Field Image) camera. \n\nIRMSS is present in CBERS-1 and -2, not however in CBERS-2B, where it was replaced by HRC (High-Resolution Panchromatic Camera).  The IRMSS operates in 4 spectral bands, thus extending the CBERS spectral coverage up to the thermal infrared range. It images a 120 km swath with the resolution of 80m (160m in the thermal channel). In 26 days one obtains a complete Earth coverage that can be correlated with the images of the CCD camera. \n\nHR camera is the first civilian high spatial resolution sensor, whose designed spatial resolution is 2.36m.  HR camera operates in a single spectral band which covers visible and near-infrared bands. It is only present in CBERS-2B, not in CBERS-1 and -2. It generates images of 27km width and resolution 2.7m, which will allow the observation of surface objects with large detail. Given its 27km swath, five 26 days cycles are necessary for the 113km standard CCD swath to be covered by HRC. \n\nThe CCD camera provides images of a 113 km wide strip with 20m spatial resolution. Since this camera has a sideways pointing capability of ± 32 degrees, it is capable of taking stereoscopic images of a certain region. In addition, any phenomenon detected by the WFI may be \"zoomed in\" by the oblique view of the CCD camera with a maximum time lag of 3 days.  The CCD camera operates in 5 spectral bands that include a panchromatic one from 0.51 to 0.73 µm. The two spectral bands of the WFI are also present in the CCD camera to allow complementing the data of the two types of remote sensing images. A complete coverage cycle of the CCD camera takes 26 days.\n\nThe WFI has a ground swath of 890 km which provides a synoptic view with spatial resolution of 260m. The Earth surface is completely covered in about 5 days.\n\nThe data collected by the satellites are used in several applications, such as CPTEC weather forecast, ocean circulation studies, tides, chemistry of the atmosphere, agriculture planning, besides others, thru more than 600 platforms installed in Brazil. One important application is the hydrological basin monitoring by the ANA and SIVAM platform networks, which provides Brazilian river and rain data.\n\nCBERS-3 is expected to be launched in 2009, CBERS-4 in 2011.  CBERS-3 and -4 satellites represent an evolution of CBERS-1 and -2. Four cameras will be present in the payload module, with improved geometrical and radiometric performance.  They are: PanMux Camera-PANMUX, Multi-spectral Camera-MUXCAM, Scanning Medium Resolution Scanner-IRSCAM and Wide Field Imaging Camera-WFICAM.  The orbits of the two satellites will be the same as for CBERS-1 and -2.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: CBERS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Solar/Space Observing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Photon/Optical Detectors\n      Instrument_Type: Cameras\n      Short_Name: CBERS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Instrument_Associated_Sensors\n      Short_Name: WIDE FIELD IMAGER\n      Short_Name: HIGH RESOLUTION CAMERA\n      Short_Name: CHARGE COUPLED DEVICE\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: CBERS-1\n      Short_Name: CBERS-2\n      Short_Name: CBERS-2B\n      Short_Name: CBERS-3\n      Short_Name: CBERS-4\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www.cbers.inpe.br/en/programas/cbers1-2.htm\n   Creation_Date: 2008-05-30\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: China National Space Administration (CNSA)\n      Instrument_Owner: Brazilian Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE)\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

As the ion accelerating voltage is varied,\nthe ion beams are scanned across the collector slits forming a series of\npeaks in the 103 current detector. The mass ranges covered are 1 to 4, 4 to\n16 and either 16 to 90 (AE-C) or 14 to 72 (AE-D) amu at the low, mid and\nhigh mass collectors respectively. The scan times are either 4 sec (AE-C)\nor 2 sec (AE-D) for the analog short mode, or 8 sec for the analog long mode.\nWhen the analog short mode is used, the mass ranges of each channel are cut\nin half. The analog short mode is used when the satellite is spinning; the\nanalog long for despun operation.\n\nThe overall accuracy is better than 20%, except in very disturbed\nregions of the ionosphere, or at extremely low densities. Sensitivity of\nthe  instrument is somewhat mass dependent, varying from 1.0 ion cm-3 for\nH,to ~10 ions cm-3 for O+ .\n\nAdditional information available at\n\"http://nssdcftp.gsfc.nasa.gov/spacecraft_data/ae/aedoc/mims.txt\"\n\n[Summary provided by NASA]\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "[Text Source: Gunter's Space Page, http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/gms-2.htm ]\n\nThe principal instrument on board all satellites in the GMS series is the visible and infrared spin scan radiometer (VISSR), which is produced by Hughes' Santa Barbara Research Center. The spacecraft body carries the VISSR and spins at 100 rpm, while the antennas are despun and remain pointed toward Earth.\n\nThe spinning motion of the satellite carries the west-east scan. The north-south scan is produced by the VISSR scan mirror, which steps approximately 0.008° with each satellite revolution.\n\nVisible spectrum information consists of reflected sunlight and is obtained when Earth's surface is illuminated by the sun. Infrared spectrum information consists of heat radiation from Earth's surface and cloud tops. Since this information contains very little sunlight reflection, it can be obtained day and night. Extremely sensitive detectors, which are kept cold by a radiative cooler, convert Earth's infrared radiation into analog signals.\n\nThe VISSR senses radiation and produces images of Earth and its atmosphere one scan line at a time, similar to the way television images are generated. About 2500 scan mirror steps or line scans are required to make a full image of the portion of Earth's disk as seen by the satellite. With its specially designed optical telescope and detectors, the VISSR obtains a complete 20° by 20° scan, produces an image of the full Earth disk every 25 minutes, and transmits that image back to Earth as weather facsimile pictures, showing different portions of the hemisphere. This enables meteorologists to identify, monitor, and track cataclysmic weather events such as windstorms, heavy rainfall, and typhoons, and to predict weather dangers long before storms reach densely populated areas.\n\nUnlike its predecessors, which carried one infrared channel each, GMS-5 carries three. Two perform the same function as the single infrared on the previous satellites. The third determines atmospheric water vapor distribution.\n\nMany aspects of weather that affect the daily lives of people exist for such relatively short periods that polar-orbit weather satellites fail to observe them. However, the GMS, from its stationary vantage point of constant observation, acquires almost instantaneous information on rapidly changing weather patterns and regional weather phenomena.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: VISSR-GMS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Imaging Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Short_Name: VISSR-GMS\n      Long_Name: Visible and Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (GMS Series)\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: GMS\n      Short_Name: GMS-5\n      Short_Name: GMS-4\n      Short_Name: GMS-3\n      Short_Name: GMS-2\n      Short_Name: GMS-1\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/gms-2.htm\n   Online_Resource: http://www.jaxa.jp/projects/sat/gms/index_e.html\n   Creation_Date: 2011-11-10\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

The detectors for each of the bands\nconsist of 5000 element silicon charge coupled detectors\n(CCD's). Only 4000 of these detectors are used at any one\ntime. A time lag occurs between the acquisition of the backward\nimage and the nadir image. During this time earth rotation\ndisplaces the image center. The VNIR subsystem automatically\nextracts the correct 4000 pixels based on orbit position\ninformation supplied by the EOS platform.\n\nThe VNIR optical system is a reflecting-refracting improved\nSchmidt design. The backward looking telescope focal plane\ncontains only a single detector array and uses an interference\nfilter for wavelength discrimination. The focal plane of the\nnadir telescope contains 3 line arrays and uses a dichroic\nprism and interference filters for spectral separation\nallowing all three bands to view the same area\nsimultaneously. The telescope and detectors are maintained at\n296 + 3K using thermal control and cooling from a platform\nprovided cold plate. On-board calibration of the two VNIR\ntelescopes is accomplished with either of two independent\ncalibration devices for each telescope. The radiation source\nis a halogen lamp. A diverging beam from the lamp filament is\ninput to the first optical element (Schmidt corrector) of the\ntelescope subsystem filling part of the aperture.  The\ndetector elements are uniformly irradiated by this beam. In\neach calibration device, two silicon photo-diodes are used to\nmonitor the radiance of the lamp. One photo-diode monitors the\nfilament directly and the second monitors the calibration beam\njust in front of the first optical element of the\ntelescope. The temperature of the lamp base and the\nphoto-diodes is also monitored. Provision for electrical\ncalibration of the electronic components is also provided.\n\nThe system signal-to-noise is controlled by specifying the NE\ndelta rho to be < 0.5% referenced to a diffuse target with a\n70% albedo at the equator during equinox.  The absolute\nradiometric accuracy is to be + 4% or better.  The VNIR\nsubsystem produces by far the highest data rate of the three\nASTER imaging subsystems.

        skos:definition  "The SeaWiFS instrument was launched by Orbital Sciences Corporation on the OrbView-2 (a.k.a. SeaStar) satellite in August 1997, and collected data from September 1997 until the end of mission in December 2010. SeaWiFS had 8 spectral bands from 412 to 865 nm. It collected global data at 4 km resolution, and local data (limited onboard storage and direct broadcast) at 1 km. The mission and sensor were optimized for ocean color measurements, with a local noon (descending) equator crossing time orbit, fore-and-aft tilt capability, full dynamic range, and low polarization sensitivity.\n\nThe SeaWiFS instrument has scanning mechanisms to\ndrive an off-axis folded telescope and a rotating halfangle\nmirror. Incoming scene radiation is collected\nby the folded telescope and reflected onto the rotating\nhalf-angle mirror. The collected radiation is then relayed\nthrough dichroic beam splitters to separate the radiation\ninto four wavelength intervals each wavelength interval\nencompassing two of the eight SeaWiFS spectral bands.\nFour corresponding aft-optics direct the radiation in the\nfour separate wavelength intervals through two separate\nspectral band-pass filters that further separate the radiation\ninto eight SeaWiFS spectral bands. The aft-optics\nassemblies also image each of the resultant defined bands\nof radiation onto four detectors that are aligned in the scan\ndirection. Monitoring of sensor calibration over periods of\na few orbits, to several months or years, is accomplished\nusing solar calibration for the former and lunar calibration\nfor the latter. Solar calibration uses a solar-radiation\ndiffuser and an input port located in a fixed position\noutside of the 58.3 degree SeaWiFS scene-scan interval. Lunar\ncalibration is accomplished by a spacecraft maneuver to\nview the moon when the spacecraft is in the nighttime\nportion of its orbit.\n\nKey SeaWiFS Facts\nScan Width: 58.3 deg (LAC); 45.0 deg (GAC)\nScan Coverage: 2,800 km (LAC); 1,500 km (GAC)\nPixels along Scan: 1,285 (LAC); 248 (GAC)\nNadir Resolution: 1.13 km (LAC); 4.5 km (GAC)\nScan Period: 0.124 seconds\nTilt: -20, 0, +20 deg\nDigitization: 10 bits\n(LAC stands for Local Area Coverage; GAC stands for Global Area\nCoverage)\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: SEAWIFS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Imaging Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Short_Name: SEAWIFS\n      Long_Name: Sea-Viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: SEASTAR\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Number_Channels: 6 channels\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.4 - 0.7 micrometers\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Near Infrared\n      Number_Channels: 2 channels\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.765 - 0.865 micrometers\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/SeaWiFS/\n   Online_Resource: http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n   Sample_Image: http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/SeaWiFS/SEASTAR/seawifs_bench.gif\n   Creation_Date: 2007-04-16\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 1997-09-01\n      Instrument_Stop_Date: 2010-12-11\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "      The Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS)\n\n      Background\n\n      The Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) is the primary\n      instrument selected for the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment\n      (ACE) mission onboard the SCISAT satellite. A second instrument,\n      Measurements of Aerosol Extinction in the Stratosphere and\n      Troposphere Retrieved by Occultation (MAESTRO), is also onboard\n      SCISAT.\n\n      The ACE-FTS was built in co-operation with the Canadian Space\n      Agency by ABB Bomem of Qu?bec City. Funding for the ACE mission,\n      including both Canadian instruments, was provided by the\n      Canadian Space Agency?s Space Science Program.\n\n      How ACE-FTS functions\n\n      The ACE-FTS instrument is designed to simultaneously measure the\n      temperature, trace gases, thin clouds, and aerosols found in the\n      atmosphere using a solar occultation technique. For this\n      technique to work, the orbiting satellite must first point to\n      the Earth's horizon during sunrise or sunset. As the sun \"moves\"\n      through the thin band of atmosphere at the horizon, its rays are\n      partly absorbed by the various gases in the atmosphere at\n      different altitudes. It is these gases and their distribution\n      that the high-resolution, infrared ACE-FTS will measure. Thus,\n      as the instrument observes the rising or setting sun, it can\n      perform its measurements throughout the whole thickness of the\n      atmosphere. Aerosols such as those caused by gases ejected by\n      volcanoes will also be measured.\n\n      SCISAT?s low orbit of 650 km above the Earth will give the\n      ACE-FTS instrument extensive coverage with an emphasis on\n      mid-latitude areas, such as Canada and the United States, as\n      well as the polar region. The area to be scanned will be from\n      about 4 km above the cloud tops (or the boundary layer for clear\n      scenes) up to about 100 km. SCISAT will orbit the Earth 15 times\n      a day, providing 30 daily opportunities (sunrises and sunsets)\n      to take its precise measurements.\n\n      Complements other experiments\n\n      ACE-FTS will measure the density of a large number of chemicals\n      in order to make an accurate estimate of both chemical loss and\n      the movement of ozone in the polar winter and springtime. Its\n      results will be complemented by those gathered by MAESTRO. The\n      overall ACE mission will work in conjunction with other\n      instruments and missions planned by NASA, the European Space\n      Agency, and other international partners over the next decade to\n      gain a better understanding of the chemistry and dynamics of the\n      stratosphere with an emphasis on ozone.\n\n      View the SCISAT homepage at:\n      \"http://www.space.gc.ca/asc/eng/csa_sectors/space_science/atmospheric/\nscisat/scisat.asp\"\n\n      [Summary provided by the Canadian Space Agency]\n"@en ;

The HCMM local times\nof equator crossings were 2 PM (ascending node) and 2 AM\n(descending node). This provided day/night coverage about once\nevery 16 days at approximately 12-hour intervals depending o\nlatitude. The HCMM provided global coverage from 85 N to 85 S,\nbut due to the lack of onboard recorders, image acquisition\nwas limited by the availability of ground receiving\nstations. Areas covered include parts of the US, western\nCanada, western Europe, northern Africa, and Eastern\nAustralia. The spatial resolution for this data is\napproximately 600 m at nadir for the IR channel (10.5-12.5\nmicrometers) and 500 m for the visible channel (0.5-1.1\nmicrometers). Specific coverage information is available from\nNSSDC. HCMM radiometer image data are available in both film\n(NSSDC ID 78-041A-01A) and digital (CCT) format (NSSDC ID\n78-041A-01B) at a scale of 1:4,000,000.

        skos:definition  "The Measurement of Air Pollution from satellite (MAPS) instrument was\nflown with the Space Radar Laboratory-1 on the Space Shuttle\n\"Endeavor\" (STS-59) launched April 9, 1994.\nThe objectives of the MAPS instrument were to measure the global\ndistribution of carbon monoxide (CO) in the troposphere and its role\nin global tropospheric chemistry. The MAPS instrument, flown on two\nprevious Shuttle flights (1981 and 1984), is a precursor to EOS-era\ninstruments. The MAPS instrument was able to detect CO and nitrous\noxide using gas filter radiometry to measure the IR absorption\nwavelength band in the atmosphere for these trace gases (4.67\nmicrometer). The MAPS instrument viewed the Earth simultaneously\nthrough three cells, one cell filled with CO, one filled with nitrous\noxide, and one filled with helium (which does not absorb at these\nwavelengths). The difference in the energy received as seen through\ncell pairs enabled researchers to derive the amount of CO and nitrous\noxide in the atmosphere. The nitrous oxide measurements provided a\nmethod for automatically rejecting cloud-contaminated observations of\nCO. The MAPS instrument consisted of the optical subassembly, which\ncontained the optical elements, blackbodies, gas cells, detectors,\npreamplifiers, and calibration unit; the electronics subassembly,\nwhich housed the signal processing and control circuits; the flight\ntape recorder subassembly; and the aerial camera subassembly, which\nprovided correlative cloud cover photos during the daylight portion of\nthe flight. MAPS is expected to fly with the SRL again in 1994 and\n1995.\n\nInformation on the MAPS sensor, visit the STS-59 site at\n\"http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-59/mission-sts-59.html\"\n\nInformation about the Space Radar Laboratory can be found on the NASA\nJPL WWW Home Page: \"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov\"\n\nPersonnel:\n\nLouis Caudill (NASA HQ) - Program Manager\nDr. Michael Kurylo (NASA HQ) - Program Scientist\nDr. Henry G.

The SNOE spacecraft is a compact hexagonal structure, 36'' high and 39'' across its widest dimension, that weighs 254 lbs. It was launched by a Pegasus XL into a circular orbit, 580 km altitude, at 97.75 degrees inclination for sun synchronous precession, on 26 Feb. 1998. It spins at 5 rpm with the spin axis normal to the orbit plane. It carries three instruments: an ultraviolet spectrometer to measure nitric oxide altitude profiles, a two-channel auroral photometer to measure auroral emissions beneath the spacecraft, and a five-channel solar soft X-ray photometer. Charles Barth is the principal investigator, and Stan Solomon is the deputy principal investigator of the SNOE project.

The system is a 17-cm Cassegrain which feeds a Fabry-Perot filter\nwith a 0.7 A bandpass. The H-alpha system provides video images of chromosphe-\nric activity that are cospatial and cotemporal with the vector magnetograms.\nResearch programs carried out with the coaligned instruments include studies\nof magnetic morphology, evaluation of magnetic shear at flare sites,\ncalculation of vertical electric currents, analysis of magnetic field\nsubmergence/emergence, studies of magnetic canopies, evaluation of magnetic\nenergy, coronal field extrapolations, Stokes profile analysis, and the study\nof magneto-optical effects.\n\nBecause the MSFC magnetograph is a dedicated system, the MSFC team can observe\neach day that weather permits.

This is provided by the capabilities of\nsonobuoys. Sonobuoys are used to determine environmental\nconditions for determination of best search tactics, to\ncommunicate with friendly submarines, and to conduct search,\nlocalization, tracking, and, as required, attack of designated\nhostile platforms.\n\nSonobuoys provide both a deployable acoustical signal source and\nreception of underwater signals of interest. These received\nsignals are transmitted to any monitoring unit(s) that then\nprocesses the signal for analysis, classification of any target,\nand recording on magnetic tape media for replay and post event\nanalysis. Both the initial detection of submarines and the\nlocalization of detected targets is usually done with passive\nsonobuoys, if possible, so as to deny for as long as possible\nthe submarine becoming aware that an adversary aircraft is\npresent. By use of established tactics, the sonobuoys allow for\nshort and long range detection of surface ships and submarines,\nthereby, allowing for prosecution of identified hostile\ntargets. Other specialized sonobuoys can detect electric fields,\nmagnetic anomalies or the light emitted by microscopic organisms\ndisturbed by the passage of a submarine [bioluminescence].\n\nActive sonobuoys are used to localize targets quickly and\naccurately in extreme environmental conditions, against a very\nquiet submarine, or in an attack mode. The released acoustic\nenergy enables an accurate location from the sonobuoy in both\nrange and bearing to the submarine. When two or more ?fixes? are\nobtained the speed and the course of the target can be\nestablished. Active buoys use a transducer to introduce acoustic\nenergy into the water and to manipulate the return echoes that\nare amplified and for VHF radio transmission. These buoys are\ndesigned for deeper depths than passive buoys.\n\nSonobuoys may be classified by size ( A, B, C,etc.) and type\n(active, passive or measurement). Most American sonobuoys are\nA-size length 36 inches, diameter 4 7/8 inches. The A-size\nsonobuoy weight varies by manufacturer and buoy type, but will\nnot exceed 39 pounds. Some other countries are using half size\nor A/2 as a standard configuration.\n\nAll sonobuoys currently in inventory are normally launched from\nstandard A-size tubes via pneumatics, free fall, or a Cartridge\nActuated Device (CAD). When launched from aircraft they employ a\nparachute to retard their descent and provide descent\nstability. Shipboard personnel may also launch them by hand or\nOver the Side (OTS). All are powered by either salt water\nactivated magnesium or silver chloride, lithium chemistry, or\nthermal batteries and are designed to scuttle at some point\nafter usable or selected life expires.\n\nAdditional information available at\n\"http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ship/weaps/sonobuoys.htm\"\n\n[Summary provided by the Military Analysis Network]\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "[Source: NASA/OCO home page, http://oco.jpl.nasa.gov/observatory/instrument/ ]\n\nThe OCO spectrometers measure sunlight reflected off the Earth's surface. The rays of sunlight that enter the spectrometers pass through the atmosphere twice, once as they travel from the Sun to the Earth, and then again as they travel from the Earth's surface to the OCO instrument. Carbon dioxide and molecular oxygen molecules in the atmosphere absorb light energy at very specific colors or wavelengths. Grating Spectrum Thus, the light that reaches the OCO instrument will display diminished amounts of energy at those characteristic wavelengths. The OCO instrument employs a diffraction grating to separate the inbound light energy into a spectrum of multiple component colors. The reflection gratings used in the OCO spectrometers consist of a very regularly spaced series of grooves that lie on a very flat surface. The back of a compact disc is an everyday example of a diffraction grating.\n\nThe characteristic spectral pattern for CO2 can alternate from transparent to opaque over very small variations in wavelength. The OCO instrument must be able to detect these dramatic changes, and specify the wavelengths where these variations take place. Thus, the grooves in the instrument diffraction grating are very finely tuned to spread the light spectrum into a large number of very narrow wavelength bands or colors. Indeed, the OCO instrument design incorporates 17,500 different colors to cover the entire wavelength range that can be seen by the human eye. A digital camera covers the same wavelength range using just three colors.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: OCO SPECTROMETERS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Spectrometers\n      Short_Name: OCO SPECTROMETERS\n      Long_Name: Orbiting Carbon Observatory Spectrometers\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: OCO-2\n      Short_Name: OCO\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Near Infrared\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.76, 1.58, 2.06 μm\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://oco.jpl.nasa.gov/observatory/instrument/\n   Online_Resource: http://www.orbital.com/SatellitesSpace/ScienceTechnology/OCO/\n   Creation_Date: 2008-12-16\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

The\nADEOS-II spacecraft failed on October 24, 2003.\n\nThe AMSR is a 14-channel, 8- frequency passive microwave radiometer\nwhich measures microwave radiation from the Earth's surface and\natmosphere. Frequencies of the AMSR are 6.9, 10.7, 18.7, 23.8, 36.5,\nand 89.0 (horizontal and vertical polarization), and 50.3 and\n52.8 GHz (vertical polarization only).

The\nEarth's surface is illuminated by four antennas and backscattered\nenergy is received either to derive data on wind fields and wave\nspectra, or to produce high resolution images. The operational\nrequirements are such that each mode needs to be operated exclusively,\nbut the Wind and Wave Modes are also capable of interleaved operation,\nin so-called 'Wind/Wave Mode'.\n\nThe engineering calibration of AMI is performed by making use of\nground-based transponders. The validation of AMI Wave and Wind\nproducts is carried out through dedicated campaigns with surface\nmeasurements from buoys and flights by instrumented aircrafts.\n\nSAR IMAGE MODE\n\n\nSAR obtains strips of high-resolution imagery 100 km in width to the\nright of the satellite track. The 10 m long antenna, aligned parallel\nto the flight track, directs a narrow radar beam (at a frequency of\n5.3 GHz) onto the Earth's surface over the swath.\n\nOn-board and on-ground signal processing is used to build up an image\nfrom the backscattered energy, which depends primarily on the\nroughness and dielectric properties of the illuminated area.\n\nThe power demands during the Image Mode are such that operating time\nhas to be limited to a maximum of 12 minutes during each orbit of\nwhich 4 in eclipse.  The data rate of 100 Mbits/s is far too high for\nonboard storage, so images can only be acquired within the reception\nzone of a suitably equipped ground station. Major advantage over\noptical sensors is the capability of microwaves to penetrate clouds,\ntherefore providing all-weather imagery capabilities.\n\nSAR Image-Mode characteristics:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nFrequency: 5.3 GHz (C-band)\nPeak power: 4.8 kW\nAntenna size: 10 m x 1 m\nPolarisation: Linear Vertical (LV)\nIncidence angle: 23 degrees at mid-swath\nData rate: less than or equal to 105 Mbit/s\nSpatial resolution: along track less than or equal to 30 m;\nacross track less than or equal to 26.3 m\nRadiometric resolution: 2.5 dB at -18 dB\nRadiometric stability: less than or equal to 0.95 dB\nSwath width: 100 km\nLocalisation accuracy: along track less than or equal to 1\nkm; across track less than or equal to 0.9 km\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMain applications of SAR Image Mode Data:\n\n\n- Ice mapping and monitoring\n- Ocean and coastal areas imaging\n- Land imaging\n\nSAR WAVE MODE\n\nWave Mode operation of the SAR provides 5 km x 6 km images at\nintervals of 200 km along track, which can then be interpreted to\nprovide wave spectra.  Because the data rate is relatively low,\nonboard data storage is possible, and there is a global sampling of\nwave spectra.\n\nSAR Wave Mode characteristics:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWave direction: 0-180 degrees\nWave length: 100-1000 m\nAccuracy: direction 20 degrees; length 25 degrees;\nSpatial sampling: 5 km x 6 km every 200-300 km,\nprogrammable anywhere within the SAR swath\nFrequency: 5.3 GHz (C-band)\nPolarisation: Linear Vertical (LV)\nIncidence angle: 23 degrees nominal\nSpatial resolution: along track less than or equal to or\nequal to 30 m across track less than or equal to 26.3 m\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nApplications of SAR Wave Mode Data:\n\n\nThe capability of ERS-1 and ERS-2 to acquire global data sets and\nimaging of ocean and ice phenomena, where previously scientists have\nhad to rely on sporadic measurements from ships or buoys, and in\ncloud-covered regions, are important in such disciplines as:\n\n- Oceanography (internal waves, small-scale variations in\nwind and\nmodulations due to surface currents, etc.)\n- Glaciology\n- Climatology\n- Meteorology (forecasts of sea conditions, etc.)\n- Geodesy\n\nAMI WIND MODE\n\n\nThe Wind Mode uses three antennas to generate radar beams looking 45\ndegrees forward, sideways, and 45 degrees backwards with respect to\nthe satellite's flight direction. These beams illuminate a 500 km-wide\nswath as the satellite moves along its orbit, and each provide\nmeasurements of radar backscatter from the sea surface on a 25 km\ngrid. The result is three independent backscatter measurements for\neach grid point, obtained using the three different viewing directions\nand separated by a short time delay. As the backscatter depends on the\nsea surface capillar roughness as a function of the wind speed and\ndirection at the ocean surface, it is possible to calculate the\nsurface wind speed and direction by using these 'triplets' within a\nmathematical model.\n\nAMI Wind Mode characteristics:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nWind direction range: 0-360 degrees\nAccuracy: 20 degrees\nWind speed range: 4-24 m/s\nAccuracy: 2 m/s or 10%\nSpatial resolution: 50 km\nGrid spacing: 25 km\nSwath stand-off: 200 km to side of orbital track\nSwath width: 500 km\nFrequency: 5.3 GHz\nPolarisation: Linear vertical (LV)\nPeak power: 4.8 kW\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMain applications of Wind Mode data:\n\n\n- Weather and sea state forecasts\n- Commercial and scientific uses (offshore exploration,\nship routing, fish resource management, etc.)\n\nRelated URL:\n\n\"http://earth.esa.int/ws\"\n\n\n\"http://earth.esa.int/sar\"\n\nReference online documentation:\n\"http://earth.esa.int/services/esa_doc/doc_wsc.html\"\n\"http://earth.esa.int/services/esa_doc/doc_sar.html\"\n\nFor any query, please refer to:\n\nESA/ESRIN Earth Observation Help Desk\n\n\"http://earth.esa.int\"\n\nE-mail: eohelp@esa.int\n\nPhone: +39 06 9410777\n\nFax: +39 06 9418292\n\nAddress:\n\nESA/ESRIN\n\nVia G.Galilei\n\n00044 Frascati\n\nItaly\n"@en ;

CME's are the most energetic eruptions on the Sun. They are responsible for essentially all of the largest solar geomagnetic storms. In order to understand and forecast CME's, we need 3-Dimensional images of them and of the ambient solar corona and heliosphere. Achieving this perspective requires moving away from our customary Earth-bound lookout point. To provide the images for a stereo reconstruction of solar eruptions, one spacecraft leads Earth and one trails Earth in its orbit about the Sun.

        skos:definition  "\nFluorescence illumination and observation is the most rapidly\nexpanding microscopy technique employed today, both in the\nmedical and biological sciences, a fact which has spurred the\ndevelopment of more sophisticated microscopes and numerous\nfluorescence accessories. Epi-fluorescence, or incident light\nfluorescence, has now become the method of choice in many\napplications and comprises a large part of this tutorial. We\nhave divided the fluorescence section of the primer into several\ncategories to make it easier to organize and download. Please\nfollow the links below to navigate to points of interest.\n\nIntroductory Concepts - Fluorescence is a member of the\nubiquitous luminescence family of processes in which susceptible\nmolecules emit light from electronically excited states created\nby either a physical (for example, absorption of light),\nmechanical (friction), or chemical mechanism. Generation of\nluminescence through excitation of a molecule by ultraviolet or\nvisible light photons is a phenomenon termed photoluminescence,\nwhich is formally divided into two categories, fluorescence and\nphosphorescence, depending upon the electronic configuration of\nthe excited state and the emission pathway. Fluorescence is the\nproperty of some atoms and molecules to absorb light at a\nparticular wavelength and to subsequently emit light of longer\nwavelength after a brief interval, termed the fluorescence\nlifetime. The process of phosphorescence occurs in a manner\nsimilar to fluorescence, but with a much longer excited state\nlifetime.\n\nAnatomy of the Fluorescence Microscope - In contrast to other\nmodes of optical microscopy that are based on macroscopic\nspecimen features, such as phase gradients, light absorption,\nand birefringence, fluorescence microscopy is capable of imaging\nthe distribution of a single molecular species based solely on\nthe properties of fluorescence emission.

The resulting electric current is proportional to the concentration of the total particle-bound PAH in the sample with no specification of which PAHs are present. The low volatility of the various PAHs reduces the amount of gaseous PAH in the sample and ensures that the sample is particle-bound PAH.

This is analyzing total electron content (TEC) data to produce electron densities as either two-dimensional maps or one-dimensional profiles. The earth's upper atmosphere contains a partially ionized plasma that is constantly changing under the influence of solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation, recombination chemistry, neutral winds, and electric fields (Rishbeth and Garriott, 1969; Kelley, 1989). The ionosphere extends from 50 km to above 1000-km altitude with variations in ion species balanced by equal densities of electrons. At altitudes below 150 km, the ions are primarily molecular. The peak densities are found in the F-layer near 300 to 400 km where atomic oxygen is the primary ion species. Above 1500-km altitude, the plasmasphere is composed of atomic hydrogen and helium ions along with an equal number of electrons to maintain neutrality. The atmospheric region known as the ionosphere is both important and complex. The ionosphere affects terres- trial radio signals. Satellite to ground links are affected by electron density irregularities that can degrade received signal strength. Communication, radar, and navigation systems often rely on predictions and measurements of ionospheric propagation conditions. Over-the-horizon radars require accurate models of the ionosphere to determine target locations \n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: TBB\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Active Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Positioning/Navigation\n      Short_Name: TBB\n      Long_Name: Tri-Band Beacon\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Radio\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 150 MHz, 400 MHz, and 1067 MHz\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&ved=0CA0QFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.engr.colostate.edu%2Fece%2Ffaculty%2Freising%2Fpdf%2Fjournals%2FECEscr00010.pdf&ei=xi3eSraQM4qN8Aa6tdVf&usg=AFQjCNG9STFHCXkqVEwNVL-WV8Aqos5Rnw&sig2=MxAFPQ7_Km6qBPWN2nbN0A\n   Online_Resource: http://www.cosmic.ucar.edu/\n   Online_Resource: http://cosmic-io.cosmic.ucar.edu/cdaac/\n   Creation_Date: 2009-10-20\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: NSF/UCAR\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "SECCHI is a suite of 5 scientific telescopes SCIP, HI and SEB that will observe the solar corona and inner heliosphere from the surface of the Sun to the orbit of Earth. These unique observations will be made in stereo from NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory STEREO. The STEREO mission was successfully launched at 8:52pm EDT on October 25, 2006 from Cape Canaveral in Florida atop a Delta II rocket.\n\nThe STEREO mission is the third in the line of Solar-Terrestrial Probes (STP) and is a strategic element of the Sun-Earth Connections Roadmap. STEREO is designed to view the three-dimensional (3D) and temporally varying heliosphere by means of an unprecedented combination of imaging and in situ experiments mounted on virtually identical spacecraft flanking the Earth in its orbit.\n\nThe primary goal of the STEREO mission is to advance the understanding of the three-dimensional structure of the Sun's corona, especially regarding the origin of coronal mass ejections (CMEs), their evolution in the interplanetary medium, and the dynamic coupling between CMEs and the Earth environment. CMEs are the most energetic eruptions on the Sun, are the primary cause of major geomagnetic storms, and are believed to be responsible for the largest solar energetic particle events.\n\nThe two spacecraft will be launched together and will use a gravity assist from the moon to slingshot the spacecraft into a heliocentric orbit. The first to enter heliocentric orbit will be the Ahead (STEREO-A) spacecraft and then two weeks later the Behind (STEREO-B) spacecraft. The two spacecraft drift away from Earth at an average rate of about 22.5 degrees per year. After the two year nominal operations phase the spacecraft will be about 90 degrees apart, each about 45 degrees from Earth. STEREO-A will drift ahead of Earth and STEREO-B behind. In order to accomplish this drift, STEREO-A will be traveling faster than Earth around the Sun and so must have an orbit slightly closer to the Sun than Earth's. Similarly, the STEREO-B must be traveling slower than Earth and must have an orbit slightly further than Earth. The orbits are shown in the Java tool along with the planets and the orbit of the sun-grazing comets in the Kreutz group.\nIt is now 2 Year, 9 Months, and 11 Days since STEREO launch at 8:52pm EDT Oct 25, 2006 from Kennedy Space Center. \n\nSummary provided by http://secchi.nrl.navy.mil/\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: SECCHI\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Solar/Space Observing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Ultraviolet Instruments\n      Short_Name: SECCHI\n      Long_Name: Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: STEREO B\n      Short_Name: STEREO A\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://stereo.gsfc.nasa.gov/instruments/instruments.shtml\n   Sample_Image: http://stereo.gsfc.nasa.gov/img/nrl.jpg\n   Creation_Date: 2009-08-05\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

SAR systems take advantage of the long-range propagation characteristics of radar signals and the complex information processing capability of modern digital electronics to provide high resolution imagery. Synthetic aperture radar complements photographic and other optical imaging capabilities because of the minimum constraints on time-of-day and atmospheric conditions and because of the unique responses of terrain and cultural targets to radar frequencies.\n\nSynthetic aperture radar technology has provided terrain structural information to geologists for mineral exploration, oil spill boundaries on water to environmentalists, sea state and ice hazard maps to navigators, and reconnaissance and targeting information to military operations. There are many other applications or potential applications. Some of these, particularly civilian, have not yet been adequately explored because lower cost electronics are just beginning to make SAR technology economical for smaller scale uses. \n\nSandia has a long history in the development of the components and technologies applicable to Synthetic Aperture Radar -- 40 years in radar, antenna, and miniature electronics development; 30 years in microelectronics; and 25 years in precision navigation, guidance, and digital-signal processing. Over the last decade, we have applied these technologies to imaging radars to meet the needs of advanced weapon systems; verification and nonproliferation programs; and environmental applications. Sandia's expertise in electromagnetics, microwave electronics, high-speed signal processing, and high performance computing and navigation, guidance and control have established us as world leaders in real-time imaging, miniaturization, processing algorithms, and innovative applications for SAR.\n\n\nAdditional information available at\nhttp://www.sandia.gov/radar/sar.html\n\n[Summary provided by Sandia National Laboratories]\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: SAR\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Active Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Imaging Radars\n      Short_Name: SAR\n      Long_Name: Synthetic Aperture Radar\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: COSMO-SKYMED\n      Short_Name: SEASAT 1\n      Short_Name: RADARSAT-1\n      Short_Name: JERS-1\n      Short_Name: ERS-1\n      Short_Name: AIRCRAFT\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www.sandia.gov/radar/sar.html\n   Sample_Image: http://www.sandia.gov/radar/images/3dsar.gif\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-31\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: Sandia National Laboratories\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

The two modules are the Sensor Module with the optical elements/detectors and the Electronics Module. The overall radiometric resolution is approximately 1 nanometer (nm). Two optical radiometers form the heart of the instrument: a monochrometer and a “Cloud Cover Radiometer” (CCR). The monochrometer measures the Earth radiance directly and selectively the Sun when a diffuser is deployed. The CCR measures the 379-nm wavelength and is coaligned to the monochrometer. The output of the CCR represents the amount of cloud cover in a scene and is used to remove cloud effects in the monochrometer data.\n\nThe SBUV/2 measures solar irradiance and Earth radiance (backscattered solar energy) in the near ultraviolet spectrum (160 to 400 nm). The following atmospheric properties are measured from this data:\n \n - The global ozone concentration in the stratosphere to an absolute accuracy of 1 percent.\n - The vertical distribution of atmospheric ozone to an absolute accuracy of 5 percent.\n - The long-term solar spectral irradiance from 160 to 400 nm Photochemical processes and the influence of “trace” constituents on the ozone layer.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: SBUV/2\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Solar/Space Observing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Ultraviolet Instruments\n      Short_Name: SBUV/2\n      Long_Name: Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet/2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: NOAA-15\n      Short_Name: NOAA-16\n      Short_Name: NOAA-17\n      Short_Name: NOAA-18\n      Short_Name: NOAA-19\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Ultraviolet\n      Number_Channels: 12\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 252.00 ± 0.05 nm - 339.89 ± 0.05 nm\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://goespoes.gsfc.nasa.gov/poes/instruments/sbuv.html\n   Online_Resource: http://www.ozonelayer.noaa.gov/action/sbuv2.htm\n   Online_Resource: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/pod-guide/ncdc/docs/klm/html/c3/sec3-8.htm\n   Sample_Image: http://www.ozonelayer.noaa.gov/action/poessat.gif\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NOAA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

Parameters, such as various amplitude ratios and time parameters (inverse of decay rate) for exponential and power-law decay were analyzed for sulphide bodies, conducting soil, superficial conductors, and cultural conductors. Time parameters T1 (exponential decay) is defined as ratio of time differences between the third and fourth channel to the logarithmic value of the relative amplitude of the two channels. Time parameter K1 (power-law decay) is defined as ratio of the difference of the logarithmic values of the delay times of the third and fourth channels to the logarithmic value of the relative amplitude of the two channels. The two parameters have been useful in recognizing sulphide conductors. Also the first channel Input amplitude and logarithmic plot of the transients appear to be helpful in conductor identification. Channel ratios seem to be the least effective parameters of conductor identification.

Ltd. of Daejeon, Korea; SaTReCi is the commercial spin-off from SaTReC), the contractor to NTU. The IRIS instrument is an upgraded version of the KITSAT-3 multispectral imager. IRIS development at SaTReCi was initiated in April 2002. 17) 18)\n\nIRIS consists of an optical and an electronics module. The optical module in turn consists of mirrors, lenses, baffles, detectors, detector front-end electronics, and structural parts. The electronics module consists of the power supply module, control module, and an IRIS-internal mass storage module. IRIS provides also a logical LVDS (Low Voltage Differential Signaling) interface to the PPU (via a RAMDisk) for real-time access to the raw data.\n\nThe IRIS instrument design features a pushbroom scanner with three spectral bands: green (520 - 600 nm), red (630 - 690 nm), and NIR (760 - 890 nm). Each of the three linear detector arrays consists of 5000 active elements, which were all manufactured on the same wafer and subsequently coated with different interference filters to select the appropriate spectral characteristic (the FPA houses a quad-linear detector array and the proximity electronics). The design provides a high degree of band-to-band alignment, i.e. 0.1 pixels. The spatial resolution is 10 m GSD (Ground Sample Distance) on a swath of 50 km. The IRIS optics employs a Mangin telescope design with a primary and secondary mirror as well as two correction lenses; the aperture diameter is 120 mm.\n\nInternally the IRIS is equipped with a redundant signal processing and control module (based on a PowerPC architecture) which preprocesses the image data (along with Reed Salomon coding) prior to storage in the 8 Gbit memory module (independent of the RAM-Disk). Access to the image data is through a 50 Mbit/s LVDS link that reads the encoded data from the storage after image acquisition and an 81 Mbit/s link that enables realtime access during imaging. \n\n[Text Source: eorportal.org, http://directory.eoportal.org/]\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: IRIS-XSAT\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Photon/Optical Detectors\n      Instrument_Subtype: Cameras\n      Short_Name: IRIS-XSAT\n      Long_Name: IRIS on X-Sat\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: X-SAT\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.52 micrometers - 0.60 micrometers\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.63 micrometers - 0.69 micrometers \n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Near Infrared\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.76 micrometers - 0.89 micrometers\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://directory.eoportal.org/presentations/7105/8557.html\n   Online_Resource: http://www.dso.org.sg/home/index.aspx\n   Sample_Image: http://directory.eoportal.org/presentations/7105/XSAT_Auto5.jpeg\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-07\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: CREST, NTU (Nanyang Technological University), DSO National Laboratories, Singapore\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

MAS provided simultaneous information on the temperature and\nozone distribution in the 20 to 90 km region and information on water\nvapor and chlorine monoxide (ClO). The MAS is a passive limb-sounding\ntotal power microwave radiometer-spectrometer. The equipment consists\nof a steerable parabolic antenna which focuses the radiation into the\nMAS Reciever Electronics (MRE). The MRE consists of three radiometers\noperating at frequencies 61 to 64 GHz, 183 GHz and 204 GHz. The\nsignals are converted to intermediate frequencies below 6 GHz which\nare then analyzed by five filterbanks in the Filter Electronic Box\n(FEB) which consists of 240 filters.  The antenna can position in\nelevation about 4 degrees with a total scan of about 13 degrees. The\ninstrument is expected to be flown on subsequent ATLAS missions. The\nMAS on ATLAS provided critical correlative measurements with the\nMicrowave Limb Sounder (MLS) and other instruments on the Upper\nAtmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).  MAS was flown on all three\nATLAS missions.\nSee Croskey, et al,\"The Milimeter Wave Atmospheric Sounder (MAS): A\nShuttle-Based Remote Sensing Experiment\",IEEE Trans.

        skos:definition  "CERES consists of two broadband scanning radiometers that measure the Earth's radiation balance and provide cloud property estimates to assess their role in radiative fluxes from the surface to the top of the atmosphere.\n\nCERES is a broadband scanning thermistor bolometer package with extremely high radiometric measurement precision and accuracy. The Terra spacecraft carries two identical instruments: one operates in a cross-track scan mode and the other in a biaxial scan mode. The CERES Terra cross-track scanning data greatly extends the CERES data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) to achieve complete global measurements by adding mid-latitude and polar observations (see CERES-FM1). TRMM data is restricted by its orbit to roughly cover 40S to 40N. Terra crosstrack data also adds observations at different times of day than TRMM (and later Aqua) in order to increase the accuracy of measuring the large diurnal cycle of the radiation fields from day to night. Finally, the CERES Terra biaxial scan mode provides new observations of the angular radiation fields in order to greatly improve the accuracy of the final fluxes of solar and thermal energy used to derive the Earth's radiation balance.\n\nEach CERES instrument has three channels--a short-wave channel for measuring reflected sunlight, a longwave channel for measuring Earth-emitted thermal radiation in the 8-12 µm \"window\" region, and a total channel for total radiation. Onboard calibration hardware includes a solar diffuser, a tungsten lamp system with a stability monitor, and a pair of blackbody sources.

        skos:definition  "The CIPS instrument is a panoramic UV (265 nm) nadir imager that views in the nadir and off-nadir direction and images the polar atmosphere at a variety of angles in order to determine cloud presence, provide the spatial morphology of the cloud and constrain the parameters of the cloud particle distribution. The instrument consists of a 2x2 array of cameras operating in a 10 nm passband centered at 265 nm, each with an overlapping FOV, and a resolution (at the nadir) of 2.5 km. The total FOV is 80 deg x 120 deg, centered at the sub-satellite point, with the 120 deg axis along the orbit track. Because of slant viewing at the edges of the FOV, the worst spatial resolution is about 6.4 km, adequate for identifying the larger-scale NLC \"bands.\" The near-polar orbit will cause the observation swaths to overlap at latitudes higher than about 70 deg, so that nearly the entire polar cap will be mapped with 15-orbit per day coverage. For the first time a synoptic morphology of cloud evolution throughout the entire season, and in both hemispheres, will be achieved.\n\nCIPS provides:\n· Panoramic nadir imaging with a 120º x 80º field-of-view (1140 x 960 km)\n· Scattered radiances from Polar Mesospheric Clouds near 83 km altitude to derive PMC morphology and constrain cloud particle size information.\n· Rayleigh scattering from the background near 50 km altitude to measure gravity wave activity\n· Multiple exposures of individual cloud elements to measure scattering phase function and detect spatial scales to approximately 2.5 km\n· Measurements of the ultraviolet band pass (265 ± 5 nm) which maximizes the cloud contrast.\n \n[Source: CIPS Instrument Description on the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) Home Page http://lasp.colorado.edu/aim/ ]\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: CIPS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Photon/Optical Detectors\n      Instrument_Subtype: Cameras\n      Short_Name: CIPS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: AIM\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Near Infrared\n      Spectral_Frequency_Resolution: 2.5 Km\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/aim/\n   Online_Resource: http://aim.hamptonu.edu/instrmt/cips.html\n   Online_Resource: http://lasp.colorado.edu/aim/\n   Creation_Date: 2008-01-16\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

The purpose of this experiment was to provide global, day/night observations of cloud cover and cloud temperature measurements to support Department of Defense requirements for operational weather analysis and forecasting. The OLS employed a scanning optical telescope driven in an oscillating motion, with optical compensation for image motion, which resulted in near-constant resolution throughout the sensor field of view. The radiometer operated in two (\"light\" and \"thermal\") spectral intervals -- (1) visible and near infrared (0.4 to 1.1 micrometers) and (2) infrared (8 to 13 micrometers). The radiometer produced, with onboard processing, data in four modes -- LF (light fine) and TF (thermal fine) data with a resolution of .56 km, and LS (light smoothed) and TS (thermal smoothed) data with a resolution of 2.8 km. There were three onboard recorders, and each had a storage capability of 400 min of both LS and TS data or 20 min of LF and TF data. For direct readout to tactical sites, the experiment was programmed so that LF and TS data were obtained at night. The infrared data (TF and TS) covered a temperature range of 210 to 310 deg k with an accuracy of 1 deg c. The LS data mode provided visual data through a dynamic range from full sunlight down to a quarter moon. This mode also automatically adjusted the gain along scan to allow useful data to be obtained across the terminator.

        skos:definition  "The CEPPAD on the Polar spacecraft, consists of three packages. Two are\nspacecraft body mounted and the third is located on the despun platform. The\nfirst body-mounted package consists of the Imaging Proton Sensor (IPS) and the\nDigital Processing Unit (DPU). The second consists of the Imaging Electron\nSensor (IES) and the High Sensitivity Telescope (HIST). The single despun\nplatform package is the Source/Lose-Cone Energetic Particle Spectrometer\n(SEPS). The IPS, IES and HIST all use the body-mounted DPU. The SEPS sensor is\nindependent of the body mounted sensor and contains a separate digital\nprocessing unit. This approach was taken because of the limitations inherent in\ncommunicating between the spacecraft body and despun platform. \n\nThe IPS measures protons over the energy range from ~10 keV to 1 MeV using a\nspectrometer which incorporates a Microstrip Solid State Detector (MSSD) having\na planar configuration with six individual elements. The IES measures electrons\nover the energy range from ~ 25 to 400 keV using a spectrometer which\nincorporates a Microstrip Solid State Detector (MSSD) having a 0.5 x 2.1 cm\nplanar configuration with five individual elements. The MSSD forms the image\nplane for a sensor segment with a \"pin-hole\" aperture. The MSSD has a thick\n\"dead layer\" and thus does not respond to protons with energies below ~ 250\nkeV. However the dead layer is sufficiently thin as that it allows the IES to\nbe sensitive to electrons with energies ~ 25 KeV or more. The \"pin-hole\"\naperture accepts electrons over a 60 degrees angular segment in a plane\ncontaining the satellite spin axis. Each of the five detector e1ements in the\nMSSD detects electrons in a ~12 degrees angular sub-interval of the 60 degrees\nfield-of-view (FOV). The complete IES system has a nominal geometric factor of\n6 x 10^-3 cm2. The nominal angular resolution of a detector element is 12\ndegrees x 12 degrees and its elemental geometric factor is approximately 3.8 x\n10^-4. Three of these detector segments provide the desired electron\nmeasurements over a FOV of +/- 12 degrees x 180 degrees. The satellite spin is\nused to obtain measurements over the full 4p steradians.\n\nAll detector elements in each segment are attached to a dedicated preamplifier.\nIn the normal mode of operation, the detector elements with fields of view\nperpendicular, parallel and anti-parallel to the spin axis are connected to a\ndedicated amplifier chain at all times. There are a total of 6 amplifier and\npulse height analyzer chains in the IES signal conditioning unit (SCU). The\nremaining four detector elements in each sensor segment are then sampled on a\ntime-share basis. Each of the remaining three amplifier chains are attached to\none of the four detector elements in each segment under DPU control. In\ngeneral, the DPU can control which 6 of the 15 detector elements are being\nsampled at any given time by the amplifier chains. The responses of the\nselected detector elements are pulse-height analyzed by 8-bit Analog-to-Digital\nConverters (ADCs) to obtain the energy for each detected particle.\n\nThe DPU samples the 5 detector elements in each ES segment according to\npre-programmed sampling schemes which utilize the sectored satellite spin to\nobtain data samples over the unit sphere. In the normal mode of operation, the\ncombined data from the 3 dedicated detector elements and the 3 program-control\nsampled detectors strips are used to build a three dimensional (3D) \"image\" of\nthe medium energy electron angular distribution. For each electron detected,\nthe polar and azimuthal angular sector and energy are known. The DPU\naccumulates the result into an array which contains the electron fluxes in 15\n(polar) by 32 or 16 (azimuthal) angular intervals for each of up to 12 energy\nranges. Within 24 seconds (4 spin periods), the complete 4p steradians can be\nsampled and within one spin period a 2D distribution function can be obtained. \n\nFor more information, see:\nhttp://leadbelly.lanl.gov/ccr/\nhttp://www.css.tayloru.edu/~physics/seps.html\nand\nhttp://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/polar/polar_inst.shtml\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: CEPPAD\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Solar/Space Observing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Particle Detectors\n      Short_Name: CEPPAD\n      Long_Name: Comprehensive Energetic Particle Pitch Angle Distribution\n   End_Group\n   Group: Instrument_Associated_Sensors\n      Short_Name: SEPS\n      Short_Name: IES-P\n      Short_Name: HIST\n      Short_Name: IPS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: POLAR\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://spacedata.bu.edu/polar_info.html\n   Online_Resource: http://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/polar/polar_inst.shtml#CEPPAD\n   Online_Resource: http://www.css.taylor.edu/~physics/seps.html\n   Sample_Image: http://spacedata.bu.edu/graphics/Polar/IPS%20Large.jpg\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 1996-02-24\n      Instrument_Owner: Los Alamos National Laboratory\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "The Laser Retroreflector Array (LRA) is used to calibrate the other location systems on the satellite with a very high degree of precision. The ability to determine a satellites precise position on orbit is critical in interpreting altimetry data used for measuring ocean surface topography.  LRA is a totally passive reflector designed to reflect laser pulses back to their point of origin on Earth. It consists of nine 39 millimeter quartz corner-cube reflectors arrayed on a circular structure on the satellites nadir side (facing Earth).  A corner-cube reflector is a special type of mirror that always reflects an incoming light beam back in the direction from which it came. The retroreflectors are optimized for a wavelength of 532 nm (green), providing a field of view of about 100ý.  The eight equally spaced peripheral cubes are oriented at 50 degrees with respect to NADIR. The array structure is aluminum alloy and the corner cubes are constrained to allow for the differential thermal expansion of the structure and the quartz corner cubes. \n\nThe LRA is an array of mirrors onboard the satellite that provides a target for laser-tracking measurements from ground stations. By analyzing the round-trip time of the laser beam, it is possible to determine precisely where the satellite is on its orbit. The laser-tracking data are analyzed to calculate the satellites altitude to within a few mm; however, because there are a small number (1015) of ground stations and the laser beams are sensitive to weather conditions, it is not possible to track the satellite continuously using the LRA alone. That is why other location systems are needed on board the satellite.\n\nKey LRA Facts\nHeritage: TOPEX/Poseidon\nFunction: Laser-tracking targets\nConfiguration: 9 corner cubes: 1 nadir looking, 8 arrayed azimuthally in truncated cone\nFOV: 110ý w/1.5 arcsec dihedral angle per cube\nDimensions: Each cube is 163-mm diameter ý 66-mm height\nMass: 0. 8 kg\nDuty Cycle: 100%\nThermal Operating Range: -65ý to 95ý C\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: LRA\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Positioning/Navigation\n      Instrument_Subtype: Laser Ranging\n      Short_Name: LRA\n      Long_Name: Laser Retroreflector Array\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: OSTM/JASON-2\n      Short_Name: JASON-1\n      Short_Name: TOPEX/POSEIDON\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Number_Channels: 1 Channel\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 532 nm (primary)\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Near Infrared\n      Number_Channels: 1 Channel\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 1064 nm (secondary)\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://god.tksc.jaxa.jp/ad2/lrra/main.html\n   Online_Resource: http://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/technology/instrument-lra.html\n   Sample_Image: http://argonautica.jason.oceanobs.com/images/missions/tp/image1.gif\n   Creation_Date: 2007-04-16\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 2002-01-15\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n      Instrument_Owner: JAXA\n   End_Group\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 1992-09-23\n      Instrument_Stop_Date: 2005-10-09\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "The Charge, Element, and Isotope Analysis System (CELIAS) instrument is\ndesigned to study the composition of the solar wind (SW) and of solar and\ninterplanetary energetic particles on SOHO. SOHO is a project of international\ncooperation between ESA and NASA. The CELIAS instrument consists of three\ndifferent sensors with associated electronics, which are optimized each for a\nparticular aspect of ion composition. These aspects are the elemental,\nisotopic, and ionic charge composition of SW or energetic ions emanating from\nthe Sun. In addition, the Solar EUV Monitor (SEM) has been included into CELIAS\nfor monitoring the absolute EUV flux from the Sun.\n\nThe CELIAS instrument consists of three different sensor units (CTOF, MTOF, and\nSTOF) coupled to a Digital Processing Unit (DPU). The energy ranges of the SOHO\nparticle instruments, the CELIAS ion sensors together with the COSTEP /ERNE\nenergetic particle experiments, cover a very wide  range (large version) in\nnuclear mass and energy space.\n\nAll three CELIAS sensors employ electrostatic deflection systems in combination\nwith time-of-flight (TOF) measurements of the impinging particles. The CTOF and\nSTOF sensors employ also silicon solid state detectors to determine the\nresidual energy of particles. Thus for these two sensors the quantities energy\nper charge, E/Q, time-of-flight (TOF), and energy, E, are determined for the\nincoming particles. CTOF and STOF are aimed at different energy ranges, CTOF\nbeing devoted to solar wind and low energy suprathermal ions, while STOF is\ndevoted to higher energy suprathermal and low energy solar energetic particles.\nThe MTOF sensor is a high resolution retarding potential mass analyzer with a\nquadrupol electric field configuration, which will be able not only to measure\nthe composition of the less abundant elements in the solar wind, but also the\nisotopic composition of the more abundant heavy ions.\n\nThe solar EUV monitor, SEM, is structurally connected with STOF. SEM consists\nbasically of a diffraction grating in front of a set of three absolutely\ncalibrated silicon light diodes, which are covered with an aluminum filter. The\ndiodes are placed at the zero - and first order diffraction image of the Sun in\norder to isolate the 30.4 nm He II line.\n\nThe digital processing unit, DPU, serves all three sensors by fully handling\nthe communications with the spacecraft. It receives rate and pulse-height data\nfrom each sensor, compresses, stores and formats it for conveying the data to\nthe S/C telemetry. It also handles the experiment control through the\ncommanding system and surveys the CELIAS housekeeping data. \n\nFor more information, see:\nhttp://www.space.unibe.ch/soho/\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: CELIAS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Solar/Space Observing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Particle Detectors\n      Short_Name: CELIAS\n      Long_Name: Charge, Element, and Isotope Analysis System\n   End_Group\n   Group: Instrument_Associated_Sensors\n      Short_Name: MTOF\n      Short_Name: CTOF\n      Short_Name: PM\n      Short_Name: SEM/SOHO\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: SOHO\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Ultraviolet\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 17-70 nm\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www.space.unibe.ch/soho/\n   Sample_Image: http://www.space.unibe.ch/soho/random/ctof.gif\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 1995-12-02\n      Instrument_Owner: Max Planck Institut fur Extraterrestrische Physik\n      Instrument_Owner: Universiy of Bern, Switzerland\n      Instrument_Owner: Max Planck Institut fur Aeronomie\n      Instrument_Owner: University of Maryland\n      Instrument_Owner: Technische Universitat Braunschweig\n      Instrument_Owner: University of Southern California\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "SYSTEM OVERVIEW\n\nLVIS is a pulsed laser altimeter and measures range by timing a short\n(<10 ns duration) pulse of laser light between the instrument and the\ntarget surface. The entire time history of the outgoing and return laser\npulses is digitized using a single detector, digitizer and timing clock.\nThis configuration unambiguously describes the range to the surface as\nwell as the vertical distribution of surfaces within each laser\nfootprint.\n\nThe LVIS system operates at altitudes up to 10 km AGL and has a 12\ndegree potential field-of-view (PFOV) within which footprints can be\nrandomly spaced across track. Scanning is performed using\ngalvanometer-driven scan mirrors that control the pointing of both the\nlaser and the telescope instantaneous field-of-view (FOV). Scan mirrors\nare positioned in a stepped pattern, stopping to fire the laser and\nintegrate the return signal at each beam location. This raster scan\npattern efficiently covers 100% of the area within the data swath.\nFootprint sizes from 1 to 80 m are possible, determined by the AGL\naltitude of the airplane and the focal length of a diverging lens in the\noutput path. The dual axis transmit scanner allows the swath pattern to\nremove forward motion of the aircraft from the collection pattern. Roll\ncompensation has also been incorporated into the software for keeping\ncollection directly below the aircraft.\n\n\nOPTICAL SYSTEM\n\nThe receiver system consists of a 200-mm diameter, 5-power telescope\nwith a 25-mm exit pupil. The telescope has a 200-mm aperture, f/2\nPetzval1(1 Petzval lens: a high speed, narrow FOV lens composed of two\nachromatic lenses positioned about an aperture stop; named after the\nAustrian optician Josef Petzvald) objective with a 400-mm focal length\ndirecting light through a 50-mm focal length f/1.8 eyepiece, which\nproduces a 25-mm collimated beam. A scan mirror, located at the exit\npupil of the telescope, directs the beam through a 10-nm bandpass filter\nand onto a 25-mm molded aspheric condenser lens which focuses onto the\n0.8-mm Si:APD detector. The scan mirror is a 25x40 mm beryllium mirror\nthat was custom designed to be lightweight for fast scanning, yet stiff\nenough to remain flat during and just after the intense acceleration of\nscanning. The receiver box can accommodate two more detectors, enabling\nthe simultaneous collection of dual-wavelength, dual-polarization data.\n\nTable 1: System characteristics of the LVIS altimeter\nTelescope aperture 20 Telescope total FOV 200 mrad\nDetector FOV 8 mrad\nDetector band width 90 MHz\nBandpass filter band width 10 nm\nDigitizer sampling rate 500 Msamp/s\nDigitizer effective bits 7\nLaser output energy 5 mJ\nLaser pulse width 10 ns (FWHM*)\nLaser spatial energy pattern TEM00 single mode\nPulse repetition rate rep-rate 100 to 500 Hz\nLaser output wavelength 1064 nm\nData rate at 500 Hz rep-rate 300 Kbytes/s\nSwath width at 10 km altitude 2.0 km\nFootprint diameter 1 to 80 m\nMaximum operating altitude >10 km\n*Full width at half maximum.\n\n\nLASER\n\nThe transmitter is a water-cooled, solid-state, diode-pumped, Nd:YAG\noscillator-only laser, designed and manufactured by Cutting Edge\nOptronics (St. Louis, MO). The laser cavity is housed in a hermetically\nsealed aluminum enclosure that measures 45x13x13 cm. Operating at rates\nof up to 500 Hz, the laser emits 5 mJ, 10 ns, Gaussian-shaped\n(temporally and spatially) optical pulses at a wavelength of 1064 nm.\nAccurate ranging to a mean elevation in a wide laser footprint can be\nconfounded by a complex spatial energy distribution across the laser\nspot, thus, the laser transmitter was required to have a single-spatial\nmode (TEM00) energy pattern. A fiber-coupling lens is placed behind the\nfinal turning mirror inside the laser enclosure to capture a small\namount (<1%) of the laser output and direct it through two optical\nfibers (start pulse and calibration pulse with 100 m (300 ns) delay).\nThe laser output beam is directed through the output scanner box\ncontaining filter wheels to control the output power to optimize return\nsignal strength, a diverging lens to control the size of the footprint\non the surface, a lockable pitch control for boresighting, and the\ngalvanometer-driven output scan mirror.\n \n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: LVIS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Active Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Altimeters\n      Instrument_Subtype: Lidar/Laser Altimeters\n      Short_Name: LVIS\n      Long_Name: Laser Vegetation Imaging Sensor\n   End_Group\n   Group: Instrument_Associated_Sensors\n      Short_Name: INS\n      Short_Name: LVIS\n      Short_Name: LIDAR\n      Short_Name: LASERS\n      Short_Name: GPS\n      Short_Name: ALTIMETERS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: AIRCRAFT\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Near Infrared\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 1064 nm\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: https://lvis.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n   Sample_Image: https://lvis.gsfc.nasa.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=96&Itemid=93\n   Creation_Date: 2008-05-16\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Data_Rate: 500 Hz rep-rate 300 Kbytes/s\n      Instrument_Owner: Laser Remote Sensing Laboratory, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

The X-SAR, designed and built by\nthe German Aerospace Research Establishment (DLR) and sponsored by the\nGerman and Italian governments, will operate at X-band (3.1-cm\nwavelength or 9600 MHz) with VV polarization. The swath width is from\n10 to 45 km at 25-km resolution with illumination angle of 15 to 60\ndegrees off-nadir. The X-SAR antenna has a fixed beamwidth of 5.8\ndegrees in elevation and 0.13 degrees in azimuth as opposed to the\nphased array, multi-polarization antenna of SIR-C.  The X-SAR was\nflown on the Shuttle STS-59 in April 1994 and the STS-68 in\nSeptember/October 1994.

        skos:definition  "\nIn simplest terms, the pressure chamber can be thought of as\nmeasuring the \"blood pressure\" of a plant, except for plants it\nis water rather than blood, and the water is not pumped by a\nheart using pressure, but rather pulled with a suction force as\nwater evaporates from the leaves. Water within the plant mainly\nmoves through very small, interconnected cells, collectively\ncalled xylem, which are essentially a network of pipes carrying\nwater from the roots to the leaves. The current model of how\nthis works is that the water in the xylem is under tension, and\nas the soil dries, or for some other reason the roots become\nunable to keep pace with evaporation from the leaves, then the\ntension increases. Under these conditions you could say that the\nplant begins to experience \"high blood pressure.\"\n\nSimply put, the pressure chamber is just a device for applying\nair pressure to a leaf (or small shoot), where most of the leaf\nis inside the chamber but a small part of the leaf stem (the\npetiole) is exposed to the outside of the chamber through a\nseal. The amount of pressure that it takes to cause water to\nappear at the petiole tells you how much tension the leaf is\nexperiencing on its water: a high value of pressure means a high\nvalue of tension and a high degree of water stress. The units of\npressure most commonly used are the Bar (1 Bar = 14.5 pounds per\nsquare inch) and the Mega Pascal (1 MPa = 10 bars).\n\nBecause tension is measured, negative values are typically\nreported. An easy way to remember this is to think of water\nstress as a \"deficit:\" the more the stress, the more the plant\nis experiencing a deficit of water. The scientific name given to\nthis deficit is the \"water potential\" of the plant. The actual\nphysics of how the water moves from the leaf within the pressure\nchamber to the cut surface just outside the chamber is more\ncomplex than just \"squeezing\" water out of a leaf, or just\nbringing water back to where it was when the leaf was cut. In\npractice, however, the only important factor is for the operator\nto recognize when water just begins to appear at the cut end of\nthe petiole.\n\nAdditional information available at\n\"http://fruitsandnuts.ucdavis.edu/crops/pressure-chamber.shtml\"\n\n[Summary provided by the Fruit and Nut Research and Information Center.]\n\n\n\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "The Transient Gamma-Ray Spectrometer (TGRS) on WIND will detect transient\ngamma-ray burst events and will make the first high-resolution spectroscopic\nsurvey of cosmic gamma-ray bursts, and will also make measurements of gamma-ray\nlines in solar flares.\nCosmic gamma-ray bursts are among the most violent and energetic processes\nknown to exist in nature, characteristically emitting most of their luminosity\nat gamma-ray wavelengths. The high-resolution spectroscopy of solar flares will\ncontribute to the study of solar flare activities and help in understanding the\ncoupling between the active corona and photosphere. \nThe TGRS instrument consists of four assemblies: detector cooler assembly,\npre-amp, and analog processing unit, all mounted on a tower on the +Z end of\nthe spacecraft, and a digital processing unit mounted in the body of the\nspacecraft. The detector is a 215 cubic cm high purity n-type germanium crystal\nof dimensions: 6.7 cm (diameter) X 6.1 cm (length), radiatively colled to 85\ndegrees K. The germanium serves as a reaction medium for incoming gamma rays,\nwhich, depending on their energy, are either stopped by or passed through the\ndetector crystal. Particle energy and angle of incidence are calculated based\non a number of primary and secondary interaction processes, including\nphotoelectric, Compton, pair and bremsstrahlung radiation as well as the\nionization energy losses of secondary electrons. A two-stage cooler surrounds\nthe detector, providing a field of view of 170 degrees. Gamma-ray bursts and\nsolar flares are expected to be detected at a frequency of several per week,\nwith typical durations between 1 second and several minutes. Between bursts the\ninstrument is maintained in a waiting mode, measuring background counting rates\nand energy spectra. When a burst or flare occurs, the instrument switches to a\nburst mode, where each event in the detector is pulse-height analyzed and time\ntagged in a burst memory. Then the instrument switches to a dump mode for\nreading out the burst memory.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: TGRS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Solar/Space Observing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: X-Ray/Gamma Ray Detectors\n      Short_Name: TGRS\n      Long_Name: Transient Gamma-Ray Spectrometer\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: WIND\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Gamma Ray\n      Number_Channels: 1\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 15 KeV - 10 MeV\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/database/MasterCatalog?sc=1994-071A&ex=2\n   Online_Resource: http://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/istp/wind/wind_inst.html#TGRS\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 1994-11-01\n      Instrument_Owner: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "Ten years after the last spaceborne flights of the precursor\nMOMS-01 in 1983/84, the new concept of a combined stereo and multi-\nspectral payload, the Modular Optoelectronic Multispectral Stereo\nScanner (MOMS-02), was realized. It was successfully operated during\nSpace Shuttle flight STS-55 from April 26 to May 6, 1993, with an\naverage orbital altitude of 296 km and a geographic coverage of\n+/- 28.5 latitude. MOMS-02 opens new horizons for Earth observation\nfrom space using three-linear stereo cameras. Investigations of the\nenvironment, agriculture, forestry and urban development as well as\ndigital mapping and landscape modelling with a high degree of\nautomation will be strongly improved by using the specific\ncapabilities of this sensor.\n\nThe entire MOMS-02 system was manufactured by DASA (German Aero-\nspace) under contract of Deutsche Agentur fuer Raumfahrt-Angelegen-\nheiten (DARA) GmbH.\nGerman Space Agency DARA GmbH.\nDept. for Special Applications\nP.O.Box 300364\nD-53183 Bonn\nFederal Republic of Germany\nPhone: +49-228-447-582\nFax:   +49-228-447-700\nTechnical Parameters:\n---------------------\n   The design features of the sensor provide at least the following\nimagery characteristics:\ni) three-linear stereo, ii) along track stereo, iii) high resolution,\niv) multispectral, v) combinations of stereo and multispectral.\nThe following spectral ranges and modes are provided:\nMultispectral bands  spectral range  spatial resolution\nband1                440-505 nm      13.5 m\nband2                530-575 nm      13.5 m\nband3                645-680 nm      13.5 m\nband4                770-810 nm      13.5 m\nPanchromatic bands  spectral range  spatial resolution\nband5               520-760 nm      4.5 m\nband6               520-760 nm      13.5 m\nband7               520-760 nm      13.5 m\nMode  Channel Combination     No. of Data Takes\n1  stereo channel 6,7; HR  15\n2  multispectral channels 1,2,3,4 12\n3  multispectral channels 3,4; stereo 6,7 7\n4  multispectral channels 1,3,4; stereo 6 -\n5  multispectral channels 1,3,4; stereo 7 1\n6  multispectral channels 2,3,4; HR 13\n7  multispectral channels 1,3,4; HR -\nMode 4 and 7 were not operated.\n   MOMS02 is designed for spectral data acquisition in visible and near\ninfrared range (four channels) and for along-track stereo recording\nusing a panchromatic channel for one nadir and two off-nadir looking\nmodules. All stereo devices have equivalent bandpasses and provide a\nground pixel size of 4.5mx4.5m (nadir: band 5) and 13.5mx13.5m\n(tilted optics: bands 6 and 7). A ground pixel size of 13.5mx13.5m\nfor the spectral channels is considered as a sound compromise between\na high spectral resolution and a reasonable signal to noise ratio.\n   For all operated modes, except the full stereo mode, the nadir orien-\ntation of the Space Shuttle was held within a limit of 1 degree. For\nthe stereo mode the roll angle limits had to be extended to 3 degrees\ndue to technical reasons.\nImaging Geometry:\n-----------------\n   The swath width for the high resolution channel can be as much as\n37 km, depending on the recording mode, and 78 km for the other\nchannels. These values are relative to the nominal altitude of 296 km.\nBecause of the viewing angle of 21.4 degrees of the two off-nadir\nstereo channels, the image swath on the Earth`s surface for these\nchannels is separated from the swath of the nadir channels by about\n120 km. The three stereo cameras allow the imaging of a strip almost\nsimultaneously with three different viewing angles in a time distance\nof about 20 seconds. Possible platform movements have to be compen-\nsated.\nData Processing and Ordering:\n-----------------------------\n\nAdditional information available at\n\"http://www.nz.dlr.de/moms2p/techdat/\"\n\n"@en ;

The HMI investigation is based on measurements obtained with the HMI instrument as part of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) mission. HMI makes measurements of the motion of the solar photosphere to study solar oscillations and measurements of the polarization in a spectral line to study all three components of the photospheric magnetic field. HMI produces data to determine the interior sources and mechanisms of solar variability and how the physical processes inside the Sun are related to surface magnetic field and activity. It also produces data to enable estimates of the coronal magnetic field for studies of variability in the extended solar atmosphere. HMI observations will enable establishing the relationships between the internal dynamics and magnetic activity in order to understand solar variability and its effects, leading to reliable predictive capability, one of the key elements of the Living With a Star (LWS) program.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: HMI-SDO\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Solar/Space Observing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Photon/Optical Detectors\n      Short_Name: HMI-SDO\n      Long_Name: Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on Solar Dynamics Observatory\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: SDO\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/mission/instruments.php\n   Online_Resource: http://hmi.stanford.edu/\n   Sample_Image: http://hmi.stanford.edu/cover_tiny.jpg\n   Creation_Date: 2009-04-24\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

The LRR data will be used for\n \n- precise orbit determination in combination with GPS tracking data for gravity field recovery\n    \n- calibration of the on-board GPS Space Receiver,\n    \n- technological experiments such as two-colour ranging\n\nThe idea of the two-colour ranging principle is to demonstrate the possibility of differential ranging with a few mm single-shot precision and thus to verify existing tropospheric correction models as well. This is accomplished by a novel design with only 4 prisms in a dense package. Only one single prism will be visible for the laser ground station most of the time. The effective reflection plane is defined with very high accuracy and minimizes the optical depth of the reflector.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: GRACE LRR\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Positioning/Navigation\n      Instrument_Subtype: Laser Ranging\n      Short_Name: GRACE LRR\n      Long_Name: Laser Retro-Reflector\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: GRACE\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/portal/\n   Creation_Date: 2009-08-14\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

Its goal is\nto explore the mesosphere and lower thermosphere globally and achieve a major\nimprovement in our understanding of the fundamental processes governing the\nenergetics, chemistry, dynamics, and transport of the atmospheric region\nextending from 60 km to 180 km.\n\nThe instrument telescope is a Cassegrain design with a picket-fence tuning fork\nchopper at the first focus, and a clamshell reimager to focus the image on the\nfocal plane. The telescope has been designed to reject stray light from the\nEarth and atmosphere outside the instrument instantaneous field-of-view (IFOV).\nThe baffle assembly contains a single axis scan mirror which permits the 2 km\nvertical IFOV of each detector to be scanned from the Earth to a 400 km tangent\nheight. Accurate vertical registration of the tangent height of the data in the\natmosphere is achieved by analysis of the 14.9 ?m CO2 channels. The telescope\nand baffle assembly are cooled to 240 K by a dedicated radiator. The focal\nplane assembly, consisting of a filter array, a detector array, and a Lyot stop\nis cooled to 75 K by a miniature cryogenic refrigerator. The detector array\ncontains discrete HgCdTe, InSb, and InGaAs detectors.\n\nAdditional information available at\n\"http://saber.larc.nasa.gov/\"\n\n[Summary provided by NASA]\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: SABER\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Profilers/Sounders\n      Short_Name: SABER\n      Long_Name: Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: TIMED\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Near Infrared\n      Number_Channels: 3\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 1.27 um - 17 um\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Infrared\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 1.27 um - 17 um\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://saber.larc.nasa.gov/\n   Sample_Image: http://saber.larc.nasa.gov/images/saber_inst2.jpg\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Data_Rate: 4 kbps\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 2001-12-07\n      Instrument_Owner: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

For cloud and\nprecipitation regions, the channels on this instrument respond\nprimarily to scattering from ice regions of clouds, with the\nlower free uencies penetrating progressively further into the\ncloud. The 183 GHz and lower-frequency channels on NIIR are\ncurrently flown on the SSMII and SSM/T2 spaceborne\ninstruments. The MIR instrument is located in the right ERA\nwing superpod and scans S7 points cross-track +- 5Q? (each seen\ncycle takes about 2.9 s)Ail channels have a beamwidth of\napproximately 3.3? resulting in a spot size of about 0.5 km at\na 10 km altitude typical of the ice scattering region in\nthunderstorms.

It follows the sun automatically using a 4 quadrant\ndetector.\n\nSpatial Resolution:\n\nSpatial resolution is a function of the solar zenith angle and\nas such is not pertinent to measurements by a sunphotometer. For\nvery accurate measurements however, it can be estimated to be\napproximately 10 * sin(zenith angle) in km. Thus for 30 degrees,\nit is 5 km.

        skos:definition  "\nThe Precise RAnge and Range-Rate Equipment (PRARE) was developed and\nmaintained as a national German experiment by the Institute for\nNavigation (INS) of the University of Stuttgart, the\nGeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam, Time Tech GmbH Stuttgart, and\nKayser-Threde GmbH Munich. Development is funded by BMFT (Germany's\nFederal Ministry for Research and Technology).\n\nPRARE was flown on the European Space Agency (ESA) European Remote\nSensing Satellites ERS-1 and ERS-2 and will be flown on the ESA\nENVISAT.\n\nPRARE is a highly accurate microwave ranging system, supported by a\nnetwork of mobile ground stations, which are used for orbit\ndetermination at decimeter level of accuracy as well as for various\ngeodetic applications.\n\nThe PRARE is designed to:\n\n- provide, in all weather conditions, precise\nsatellite-to-ground or ground-to-satellite\nrange and range-rate information\n- guarantee very reliable measurements through\ncross-checks and calibration procedures\n- ensure highly effective operation of the ground\nsegment through data collection and dissemination\nvia the satellite itself and control of the global\nnetwork via one central ground station\n- allow fast product generation at an archiving,\nprocessing and distribution centre.\n\nIn this two-way microwave ranging system, the on-board equipment\nperforms the measurements in X-band (8.5 GHz), with some additional\nfunctions in S-band (2.2 GHz) for ionospheric correction purposes.\n\nThe PRARE measures range and Doppler (range rate) between the\nsatellite's antenna and up to four ground stations simultaneously. It\nis an autonomous system for precise satellite orbit observation.  It\nconsists of the space segment with its own computer and data storage\nmedium, and the ground segment, the unattended user ground stations, a\ndedicated command station and a master station for receiving the data\ndumps. PRARE operates in X-band and, in the downlink, also in\nS-band. Thus, the ionospheric total electron content (TEC) can be\ndetermined along the line-of-sight from the ground station to the\nsatellite.\n\nThe applications of PRARE are:\n\n- precise satellite orbit determination\n (e.g.  of altimeter and geodynamic satellites)\n- earth gravity field\nrecovery\n- precise point positioning (tectonics)\n- earth rotation\nparameter determination and measurement of the ionospheric total\nelectron content (TEC).\n\nIn the measurement process the space segment is the active part,\ni.e. the satellite is the start and end point of the two-way line and\nthe Range and Doppler correlations take place on-board. A ground\nstation only turns the signal around after amplification and after\nmodulating the S/X-band travel time difference and meteorological data\non the carrier. All data are collected on-board and dumped during\ncontact with the master station. The space segment also provides\nupdated orbit and schedule data to the ground stations in the\ndownlink. With this design it is possible to operate a global ground\nstation network without external data transmission\nfacilities. Especially important is that even the host satellite is\nnot encumbered by the PRARE data flow.\n\nRelated URL:\n\n\n\"http://op.gfz-potsdam.de/prare/general/general.html\"\n\n\n\"http://earth.esa.int/ers/prare\"\n\n\n\nReference online documentation:\n\n\n\"http://earth.esa.int/services/esa_doc/doc_pra.html\"\n\nFor any query, please refer to:\n\nESA/ESRIN Earth Observation Help Desk\n\n\"http://earth.esa.int\"\n\nE-mail: eohelp@esa.int\n\nPhone: +39 06 94180777\n\nFax: +39 06 94180292\n\nAddress:\n\n   ESA/ESRIN\n\n   Via G.Galilei\n\n   00044 Frascati\n\n   Italy\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "The Toroidal Imaging Mass-Angle Spectrograph (TIMAS) instrument measures the\nfull three-dimensional velocity distribution functions of all major\nmagnetospheric ion species with one-half spin period time resolution. The TIMAS\nis a first order double focusing (angle and energy), imaging spectrograph that\nsimultaneously measures all mass per charge components from 1 AMU/e to greater\nthan 32 AMU/e over a nearly 360 degrees by 10 degree instantaneous\nfield-of-view in 20 milliseconds. Mass per charge is dispersed radially on an\nanular microchannel plate detector and the azimuthal position on the detector\nis a map of the instantaneous 360 degrees field of view. With the rotation of\nthe spacecraft, the TIMAS sweeps out a 4pi solid angle image in a half spin\nperiod. The energy per charge range from l5eV/e to 32 keV/e is covered in 28\nnon-contiguous steps spaced approximately logarithmically with adjacent steps\nseparated by about 30%. In order to handle the large volume of data within the\ntelemetry limitations the distributions are compressed to varying degrees in\nangle and energy, log-count compressed and then further compressed by a\nlossless technique. This data processing task is supported by two SA3300\nmicroprocessors. The voltages (up to + 5 kV) for the tandem toroidal\nelectrostatic analyzers are supplied from common high voltage supplies using\noptically controlled series-shunt regulators.\n\nFor more information, see:\nhttp://lasp.colorado.edu/timas/TIMAS_description.html\nand\nhttp://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/polar/polar_inst.shtml\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: TIMAS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Solar/Space Observing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Particle Detectors\n      Short_Name: TIMAS\n      Long_Name: Toroidal Imaging Mass-Angle Spectrograph\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: POLAR\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://lasp.colorado.edu/timas/TIMAS_description.html\n   Sample_Image: http://lasp.colorado.edu/timas/Full_size_b.gif\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 1996-02-24\n      Instrument_Owner: Lockheed Martin Missiles & Space Company\n      Instrument_Owner: Southwest Research Institute\n      Instrument_Owner: Mullard Space Science Laboratory, University College, UK\n      Instrument_Owner: University of Berne, Switzerland\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "[Source: GFZ/Potsdam, http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/ ]\n\nThe SuperSTAR accelerometer manufactured by ONERA/CNES (France) is a modified version of the ASTRE high precision accelerometer previously flown on different Shuttle-missions (Life and Microgravity Science Mission (STS-78, 1996), Microgravity Science Laboratory (STS-83, STS-94, 1997)) and the STAR accelerometer which will be operated on the CHAMP satellite.\n\nThe accelerometer serves to measure all non-gravitational accelerations on the GRACE satellite due to air drag, solar radiation pressure or attitude control activator impulses initiated by the attitude and orbit control system (AOCS). In combination with the sub-mm intersatellite distance observed by the k-band ranging system (KBR) and the accurate satellite position measured by the onboard GPS receiver, the Earth's gravity field can be deduced with unprecedented accuracy.\n\nThe measurement principle of the SuperSTAR accelerometer is based on the electrostatic suspension of a parallel-epipedic proof-mass inside a cage. The cage walls are equipped with control electrodes which serve both as capacitive sensors to derive the instantaneous proof-mass (PM) position and as actuators to apply electrostatic forces in order to keep the PM motionless in the centre of the cage. Because the ACC sensor is hard-mounted with the GRACE satellite body, the amount of these control forces in combination with the well known proof-mass  can be used to derive the acceleration vector for any moment of time.\n\nThe PM has to be positioned very precisely at the Center of Gravity (CoG) of the GRACE satellite to avoid acceleration offsets and measurement disturbances. In order to meet the very high requirements for GRACE gravity recovery this offset shall be measured with an accuracy of 50 µm in all 3 axis and corrected by a Center of Mass Trim Assembly (CMT). The planned resolution of the CHAMP STAR accelerometer is 1 · 10-9  ms-2  integrated over the frequency bandwith of 2 x 10-4  Hz to 0.1 Hz. Its full measurement range is 10-3  ms-2 . Because of the low-vibration design of the GRACE spacecraft and the high temperature stability (below 0.1° Celsius) the SuperSTAR ACC full scale range will be increased to 5 · 10-5  ms-2 . Additional improvements (proof mass offset voltage reduction from 20V to 10V, smaller acceleration bias and bias fluctuations by a factor of 20) increases the GRACE ACC resolution to 1 · 10-10  ms-2 . For the correct interpretation of the ACC measurements the attitude of the ACC will be measured very precisely by a star camera assembly (SCA).\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: GRACE ACC\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Positioning/Navigation\n      Instrument_Subtype: Radar\n      Short_Name: GRACE ACC\n      Long_Name: GRACE SuperSTAR Accelerometer\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: GRACE\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Radio\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 10-3 ms-2\n      Spectral_Frequency_Resolution: 2 x 10-4  Hz to 0.1 Hz\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://eospso.gsfc.nasa.gov/eos_homepage/mission_profiles/docs/GRACE.pdf\n   Online_Resource: http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/portal/\n   Creation_Date: 2007-07-06\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n      Instrument_Owner: GFZ Potsdam\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "\nGeoSAR (Geographic Synthetic Aperture Radar) is an airborne radar\nsystem that will generate high-resolution, three-dimensional maps to\nexplore and study California.  GeoSAR is being developed by a\nconsortium consisting of the California Department of Conservation,\nCalgis Inc., and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, with funding\nprovided the the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).\n\nThe project will develop a dual-frequency airborne radar system that\nwill be able to collect 249 square kilometers (94 square miles) of\ndata a minute.  A special feature of GeoSAR will be its ability to\nacquire three-dimensional images of the Earth's surface through a\ntechnique call interferometry. Because GeoSAR uses radar, the system\nwill be able to operate both day and night, under almost any weather\ncondition. GeoSAR will be the first instrument that will be able to\nmap both above, through, and below the vegetation canopy providing\nimportant information such a data about landslides that are overgrown\nwith vegetation. The GeoSAR radar system is a dual frequency design\nusing both P- and X-band wavelengths. The longer P-band wavelength\nwill penetrate deeper into the canopy and, coupled with computer\nmodeling, map beneath the vegetation canopy.  When combined with other\nremote sensing data such as Landsat multi-spectral information, it\nwill be possible to not only determine land cover type such as tree\nspecies, but also tree height and perhaps even width, such as crown\ndiameter. Maps created with the GeoSAR data will be used to assess\npotential goelogic/seismic hazards, such as landslides, classify land\ncover, map farmlands and urbanization, and manage forest\nharvests. This system will become operational in early 2000.\n\nFor more information see:\n\n\"http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov/html/projects/geosar.html\"\n\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "\n     The most straightforward way to measure temperature versus\ndepth in the ocean is to lower a thermometer a known distance and\ntake the temperature.  So-called 'protected reversing thermometers'\nhave been developed for just that purpose, and are routinely\naccurate to 0.02 degrees C.  One disadvantage of this method is\nthat temperatures can only obtained for a few depths.\n     The great advantage of the 'bathythermograph' is that,\nalthough less accurate than the reversing thermometer, it gives a\ncontinuous trace of temperature against depth.  A liquid-in-metal\nthermometer causes a metal point to move in one direction over a\nsmoked glass slide which is itself moved at right angles to this\ndirection by a pressure sensitive bellows.  The instrument is\nlowered to its permitted depth (generally 60, 140 or 270 m) and\nthen brought back up.  Since pressure is directly related to depth,\nthe line scratched on the smoked glass forms a graph of temperature\nagainst depth.  It is read against a calibration grid to a typical\naccuracy of 0.2 degrees C and 2 meters.\n     In wide use now is the expendable bathythermograph (XBT) which\nuses a thermistor as temperature sensitive element.  The thermistor\nis in a small streamlined weighted casing which is simply dropped\nover the ship's side.  It is connected by a fine wire, on special\nfree-unwinding spools, to a recorder on the ship which traces the\ntemperature of the water in a graphical plot against depth.  The\ndepth is not sensed directly but estimated from the time elapsed\nsince release, using the known rate of sink of the thermistor\ncasing.  This casing is relatively inexpensive and is not\nrecovered.  These XBTs are available for depth ranges from 200 to\n1800 meters, and can be used from ships underway or from circling\naircraft.  They can also be dropped from aircraft in a small buoy\nwhich contains a radio transmitter to send temperature/depth\ninformation to the aircraft while it continues its flight.\n     The temperature range and depths of several commercial\nbathythermographs are given below:\nMANUFACTURER   TEMPERATURE RANGE     DEPTH\n                   degrees C           m\nBelfort            -1 to 30        60/135/250\n                   -2 to 32        55/137/274\nGM                 -2 to 32        60/137/274\nJules Richard      -2 to 30        50/150/300\nKahl               -2 to 30        60/137/274\nMashprib           -2 to 30        200\nWallace & Tiernan  -1 to 30        60/135/270\nT.S.K.             -2 to 32        75/150/270\nTaken from:\nPickard, G.L, Descriptive Physical Oceanography, 3rd edition,\n     Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1979.

        skos:definition  "The objective of the Active Cavity Radiometer (ACR) Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM) is to measure the total solar irradiance with state-of-the-art accuracy and precision.  The ACRIM instrument was first flown on the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM/ACRIM I) satellite and was flown on all three Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science (ATLAS) missions and the Spacelab 1 misson from the Space Shuttle.  In addition, ACRIM was flown as a flight-of-opportunity instrument on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS/ACRIM II) and is scheduled to fly as a flight-of-opportunity mission during NASA's Earth Observation System (EOS) program (ACRIMSAT/ACRIM III) The principal role of the ACRIM is to support extended solar irradiance experiments on free-flying satellites and establishment of the radiation scale at the solar total flux level through direct intercomparison with other experiments. The total solar irradiance (TSI) from far ultraviolet through far infrared is measured by three Type V active-cavity radiometer sensors. These detectors are electrically self-calibrated, cavity pyrheliometers each capable of defining the absolute radiation scale with an uncertainty of +/- 0.1% SI units. The single sample irradiance precision is +/- 0.012 %. The three sensors are independently shuttered and their measurement cycles are different so that the three sensors can be used in various combinations to provide periodic cross references on the system's performance. \n\nThe ACRIM contains four cylindrical bays. Three of the bays house independent heat detectors, called pyrheliometers, which are independently shuttered, self calibrating, automatically controlled, and which are uniformly sensitive from the extreme UV to the far infrared. Each pyrheliometer consists of two cavities, and temperature differences between the two are used to determine the total solar flux. One cavity is maintained at a constant reference temperature, while the other is heated 0.5 K higher than the reference cavity and is exposed to the Sun periodically. When the shutter covering the second cavity is open, sunlight enters, creating an even greater difference in cavity temperatures. The power supplied to the second cavity by the ACRIM electronics decreases automatically to maintain the 0.5 K temperature difference between the two cavities. This decrease in the amount of electricity is proportional to the solar irradiance entering the cavity. Additional details about the individual sensors is given by Willson (1979 & 1980) and of the instrument by Willson (1981). The fourth bay holds a sensor that measures the relative angle between the instrument and the Sun.\n\nTo guarantee precision, the ACRIM cavities have mirror-like black surfaces that reflect light toward the apex of the cavity, where 99.99998 percent of the Sun's incoming energy in the 180 to 3,000 nm wavelength range is absorbed. In normal operation the ACRIM is on a platform which tracks the Sun. One of its detector channels makes regular measurements while the other two are kept shuttered to reduce possible degradation by solar UV radiation, atmospheric or satellite outgassed gases, etc. Readings are taken at 1.024 second intervals. About once a month the second channel, B, is opened for comparison measurements; while at longer intervals the third channel, C, is also compared. This triple detector arrangement proved valuable. On the SMM Satellite channel A degraded about 600 parts per million compared to channel C during the 9.75 year mission. Channel B, opened roughly once a month, also showed a slight degradation compared to channel C by 1989. This degradation was allowed for in the calibration equation (Willson and Hudson, 1991).\n\nNote: ACRIM II was not officially part of the UARS project. It was included on the UARS platform as an instrument of opportunity.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: ACRIM\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Solar/Space Observing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Visible/Infrared Instruments\n      Short_Name: ACRIM\n      Long_Name: Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: SMM\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Near Infrared\n      Number_Channels: 3\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 180 nm to 3.000 nm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://acrim.jpl.nasa.gov/\n   Online_Resource: http://acrim.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/mission_heritage.html\n   Online_Resource: http://www.acrim.com/\n   Creation_Date: 2007-05-10\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Data_Rate: 32 kbit/s\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 1991-04-10\n      Instrument_Stop_Date: 2001-11-01\n      Instrument_Owner: NASA +  Jet Propulsion Lab - JPL\n      Instrument_Owner: Columbia University\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "The TRMM Microwave Imager (TMI) is an instrument on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Satellite which was launched on November 27, 1997 from the Tanegashima Space Center in Japan. The TMI, designed for NASA by Hughes, is a five-channel, dual-polarized, passive microwave radiometer. Microwave radiation is emitted by the Earth's surface and by water droplets within clouds. However, when layers of large ice particles are present in upper cloud regions - a condition highly correlated with heavy rainfall - microwave radiation tends to scatter. The TMI will detect radiation at five frequencies chosen to discriminate among these processes, thus revealing the likelihood of rainfall. The key to accurate retrieval of rainfall rates by this method is the deduction of cloud precipitation consistent with the radiation measurement at each frequency. The TMI data, supported by PR data, will be the primary data set of precipitation measurement.    \n\nTMI is a passive microwave radiometer designed to provide quantitative rainfall information over a wide swath. By carefully measuring the minute amounts of microwave energy emitted by Earth and its atmosphere, TMI is able to quantify the water vapor, the cloud water, and the rainfall intensity in the atmosphere. It is a relatively small instrument that consumes little power. This, combined with the wide swath and the good, quantitative information regarding rainfall, makes TMI the workhorse of the rain-measuring package on TRMM.  \n\nThe average operating altitude for TRMM was changed from 350 to 403 km during the period of August 7-24, 2001. This orbit boost maneuver extended the mission life significantly. All post-boost data products had been released by the TRMM Science Project, as of early December 2001.

These images will show how solar irradiance sources vary in local magnetic fields and they will show any other sources of solar irradiance variation such as that due to the hypothetical giant cells. This is the best observational approach to characterizing potential causes of the long-term irradiance variations. Discovery of other predicted sources of secular variability, such as torsional waves and meridional flow variations, would constitute a major advance for solar physics and for policy response to global warming.\n\nSBI uses a 30-cm diameter F/12 Dall-Kirkham telescope with uncoated mirrors and neutral density filters to provide high precision measurements over the wavelengths from 0.28 microns to 2.6 microns. The SBI sensor has the unique capability to record images of the solar photosphere with a flat photometric response.  Each frame from the SBI will be precisely calibrated.  Bursts of 60 to 120 frames of the same scene will be co-registered and summed to increase the signal-to-noise ratio.  The scenes will be mosaiced to form images with 5 arc-second resolution over the entire Sun.\n\nThe calibrated, mosaiced SBI images will be used to derive data products such as 3D plots of intensity contrast versus magnetic flux and distance from Sun center.  Inferred solar irradiance variations will be compared with SORCE/TIM and ACRIMSAT measurements.

Nine channels are routinely utilized in solar occultation measurements and three channels are used in lunar measurements.  Spectral calibration is continuous, combined with the self-calibrating nature of the occultation technique. In addition, the CCD array permits in-orbit wavelength and intensity calibration from observations of the exo-atmospheric solar Fraunhofer spectrum.\n\nInformation obtained from http://www.eoportal.org/\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: CCD LINEAR ARRAY\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Photon/Optical Detectors\n      Instrument_Subtype: Cameras\n      Short_Name: CCD LINEAR ARRAY\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: METEOR-3M\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://directory.eoportal.org/get_announce.php?an_id=8273\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-11\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

The Radio and Plasma Wave experiment (WAVES) on WIND will measure the properties of these waves and other wave modes of the plasma over a wide frequency range. Analyses of these measurements, in coordination with the other onboard plasma, energetic particles, and field measurements, will further the understanding of solar wind and interplanetary plasma processes.\n\nThe sensor system of the WAVES experiment consists of three electric antenna systems (two coplanar, orthogonal wire antennas in the spin-plane and a rigid spin-axis dipole) and a triaxial magnetic search coil. The longer and shorter spin plane dipoles have lengths of 50 m and 7.5 m for each wire, respectively, while each spin-axis dipole extends 5.28 m from the top and bottom surfaces of the spacecraft. The triaxial magnetic search coil for measuring bi-frequency magnetic fields is mounted at the outboard end of a 12-m radial boom.\n\nThere are five main receiver systems: a bi-frequency (DC to 10 kHz) Fast Fourier Transform receiver, a broadband (4 kHz to 256 kHz) electron thermal noise receiver, two swept-frequency radio receivers (20 kHz to lMHz, and lMHz to 14 MHz), and a time domain waveform sampler (up to 120,000 samples per second). The DPU controls and acquires data from all operations of the experiment, and can be reprogrammed from the ground. The receiver systems and DPU are housed within the spacecraft body. WAVES has onboard interconnects with 3-D PLASMA and with SWE.  \n\nFor more information, see:\nhttp://ssed.gsfc.nasa.gov/waves/\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: WAVES\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Solar/Space Observing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Radio Wave Detectors\n      Short_Name: WAVES\n      Long_Name: Radio and Plasma Wave Investigation\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: WIND\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Radio\n      Number_Channels: 5\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 4 kHz - 14 MHz\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://ssed.gsfc.nasa.gov/waves/\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 1994-11-01\n      Instrument_Owner: NASA\n      Instrument_Owner: Paris-Meudon Observatory\n      Instrument_Owner: University of Minnesota\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "GWR Instruments, Inc. is the exclusive manufacturer of the Superconducting Gravimeter (SG). The SG uses persistent supercurrents, which are trapped in superconducting magnets, to produce an ultra stable magnetic field which levitates a superconducting test mass (sphere). The SG consists of two basic components: 1) the Gravimeter Sensing Unit (GSU) which includes: the superconducting magnets, the sphere, circuitry for energizing the coils, temperature control circuitry and magnetic shielding; and 2) the liquid helium tank (Dewar) and refrigeration system which keeps the GSU close to 4.2OK to maintain the superconducting state. In 1993, GWR introduced the CT Compact Tidal Gravimeter which dramatically decreased the overall size of the SG and simplified field installation. The standard support equipment for the Compact Tidal Gravimeter includes a pair of cryogenic tilt meters, an automatic tilt compensating system, a gravimeter electronics package, a current supply/heater pulser, a helium level sensor and a helium transfer kit. The Compact SG is routinely equipped with the CD-125 Standard holdtime Dewar refrigeration system. This allows the gravimeter to operate for approximately 500 days between liquid helium refills.\n\nSome users of the SG have found that it is necessary to remove small infrequent offsets from the gravity data to preserve the baseline (zero) on a continuous record. However, geophysical signal and noise sources often mask the offsets and make them difficult to measure and remove precisely. In response to this need, GWR now manufactures a new Dual Sphere SG GSU that incorporates two levitated test masses into a single sensor (See section I.A.2). Since it is unlikely that offsets occur on both spheres simultaneously, the differential signal gives a precise measurement of any offsets that may occur in the record. This makes offset identification and removal a straightforward procedure during data processing.\n\nIn response to customers&#039; requests, GWR has also developed a second high performance refrigeration system. This Ultra Long Holdtime (ULHD) Dewar (See section II.B) allows indefinite operation after a single filling of liquid helium.

        skos:definition  "The Wide Field Sensor (WiFS) is on-board the Indian Remote Sensing Satellite 1C (IRS-1C) launched in 1996. It collects images during mid-morning (about 10:30 AM) with a spatial resolution of about 200 meters in both a red and near-infrared spectral band. The temporal resolution/revisit time frame is five days, which is an improvement over the two weeks of the Landsat systems, but still not as frequent as that of the GOES (every 15-30 minutes) or SeaWiFS (once per day). A major advantage of this data set is that it fills in the spatial resolution gap between the Landsat TM and MSS (30 and 75 meters, respectively) and the GOES and SeaWiFS (1 km) data sets. This, combined with the fact that our eolian erosion vulnerability image-mapping algorithm uses the red and near-infrared bands (the two bands collected by WiFS), allows excellent regional image maps to be made using these data. The five day temporal resolution makes them better than the Landsat MSS and TM data for possible i maging of active dust storms, but still not acceptable for operational monitoring and detection of active dust storms.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: WIFS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Imaging Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Short_Name: WIFS\n      Long_Name: Wide Field Scanner\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: IRS-P3\n      Short_Name: IRS-1D\n      Short_Name: IRS-1C\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Number_Channels: 2\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.62 μm - 0.68 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Near Infrared\n      Number_Channels: 2\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.77 μm - 0.86 μm\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www.nrsa.gov.in/satellites/irs-1d.html\n   Creation_Date: 2008-08-15\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: India\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "[Text Source: NASA Real Time Mission Monitor project home page, http://rtmm.nsstc.nasa.gov/ ]\n\nThe NASA Real Time Mission Monitor (RTMM) is a situational awareness tool that integrates satellite, airborne and surface data sets; weather information; model and forecast outputs; and vehicle state data (e.g., aircraft navigation, satellite tracks and instrument field-of-views) for field experiment management. RTMM optimizes science and logistic decision-making during field experiments by presenting timely data, graphics and visualizations to the users to improve real time situational awareness of the experiment's assets. The RTMM is proven in the field as it supported program managers, scientists, and aircraft personnel during the 2006 NASA African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analyses (NAMMA) experiment in Cape Verde, the 2007 Tropical Composition, Cloud and Climate Coupling (TC4) experiment in Costa Rica, the 2007 NOAA-NASA Hurricane Aerosonde Demonstration Project, the 2008 Arctic Research of the Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellite (ARCTAS) experiments, and the 2008 Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment (SMAP VEX) .  The integration and delivery of this information is made possible through data acquisition systems, network communication links and network server resources built and managed by collaborators at NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) and Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC).  RTMM is evolving towards a more flexible and dynamic combination of sensor ingest, network computing, and decision-making activities through the use of a service oriented architecture based on community standards and protocols.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: RTMM\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: In Situ/Laboratory Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Recorders/Loggers\n      Short_Name: RTMM\n      Long_Name: Real Time Mission Monitor\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: COMPUTER\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://rtmm.nsstc.nasa.gov/\n   Creation_Date: 2012-05-15\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "LIS is designed to investigate the global incidence of lightning, its correlation with convective rainfall, and its relationship with the global electric circuit. Conceptually, LIS is a simple device, consisting of a staring imager optimized to locate both intra cloud and cloud-to-ground lightning with storm-scale resolution over a large region of surface on Earth, to mark the time of occurrence, and to measure the radiant energy. It will monitor individual storms within the field of view (FOV) for 80 seconds, long enough to estimate the lightning flash rate. Location of lightning flashes is determined to within 5 km over a 600-km × 600-km FOV. \n\nThe LIS design uses an expanded optics wide-FOV lens, combined with a narrow-band interference filter that focuses the image on a small, high-speed, charge-coupled-device focal plane. The signal is read out from the focal plane into a real-time data processor for event detection and data compression. The particular characteristics of the sensor design result from the requirement to detect weak lightning signals during the day when the background illumination, produced by sunlight reflecting from the tops of clouds, is much brighter than the illumination produced by the lightning. \n\nA combination of four methods is used to take advantage of the significant differences in the temporal, spatial, and spectral characteristics between the lightning signal and the background noise. First, spatial filtering is used to match the instantaneous FOV of each detector element in the LIS focal-plane array to the typical cloud-top area illuminated by a lightning event (about 5 km). Second, spectral filtering is applied, using a narrow-band interference filter centered about the strong hypoiodite ion (OI) emission multiplet in the lightning spectrum at 777.4 nm. Third, temporal filtering is applied. The lightning pulse duration is of the order of 400 microseconds, whereas the background illumination tends to be constant on a time scale of seconds. The lightning signal-to-noise ratio improves as the integration time approaches the pulse duration. Accordingly, an integration time of 2 ms is chosen to minimize pulse splitting between successive frames and to maximize lightning delectability. Finally, a modified frame-to-frame background subtraction is used to remove the slowly varying background signal from the raw data coming off the LIS focal plane. If, after background removal, the signal for a given pixel exceeds a specified threshold, that pixel is considered to contain a lightning event. \n\nLIS investigations are striving to understand processes related to, and underlying, lightning phenomena in the Earth atmosphere system. These processes include the amount, distribution, and structure of deep convection on a global scale, and the coupling between atmospheric dynamics and energetics as related to the global distribution of lightning activity. The investigations will contribute to a number of important EOS mission objectives, including cloud characterization and hydrologic-cycle studies. Lightning activity is closely coupled to storm convection, dynamics, and microphysics, and can be correlated to the global rates, amounts, and distribution of convective precipitation, to the release and transport of latent heat, and to the chemical cycles of carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen. LIS standard products include intensities, times of occurrence, and locations of lightning events. The performance of LIS has exceeded specifications and has been returning unprecedented data on lightning activity. LIS is enabling investigators to quantify relationships between lightning, convection, and ice production. \n\n NASA Earth Science Reference Handbook [ Mission: TRMM ]\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: LIS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Imaging Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Short_Name: LIS\n      Long_Name: Lightning Imaging Sensor\n   End_Group\n   Group: Instrument_Associated_Sensors\n      Short_Name: LIS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: TRMM\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Near Infrared\n      Spectral_Frequency_Resolution: 0.777 micrometers with 5-km spatial resolution and 2-ms temporal resolution over an imaging area of 600 km × 600 km.\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://thunder.nsstc.nasa.gov/data/index.html\n   Online_Resource: http://lightning.nsstc.nasa.gov/lis/index.html\n   Online_Resource: http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov/overview_dir/lis.html\n   Online_Resource: http://thunder.msfc.nasa.gov/bookshelf/pubs/LIS_ICAE99_Print.pdf\n   Online_Resource: http://pmm.nasa.gov/TRMM/LIS\n   Sample_Image: http://lightning.nsstc.nasa.gov/lis/graphics/lis_sensor.jpg\n   Creation_Date: 2007-05-08\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Data_Rate: 500 frames per second\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 1997-11-30\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "\nThe altimeter is a 13.5 GHz near-nadir pointing radar which measures\nthe range to the surface of the ocean.  The height measurement from\nthe altimeter to the ocean surface is useful in various oceanographic\napplications.  Determination of sea surface topography is useful for\nmarine gravity determinations, seafloor bathymetry estimations, and\ndynamic circulation of the oceans.\n\nIn addition, wave height and wind speed can be measured by altimeters.\nThe characteristics of the radar return signal are determined by the\nocean surface. The wave height is found from the sharply rising\nleading edge slope of the return wave form, and the amplitude of the\nocean return signal is a measure of the backscatter coefficient which\nis related to wind speed.\n\nThe earliest returns from the transmitted radar pulse come from the\nwave crests with contributions increasing with time from reflectors\ndeeper in the waves. The plateau region of the wave form, which is at\na fairly constant level is reached at about the time that the first\nreflectors from the wave troughs are received. As a result the return\nsignal has a steep slope in low sea states and a relatively gentle\nslope in high wave heights. The mathematical model relating the shape\nof the leading edge to significant wave height assumes that the sea\nsurface is Gaussian and linear. Amplitude of the ocean return signal\nis normalised by an automatic gain control (AGC) loop. This AGC\nsetting is a measure of the backscatter coefficient (radar\ncross-section, s0) at the surface which depends on wind speed.\n\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "The Coastal Zone Color Scanner Experiment (CZCS) onboard the Nimbus-7\nspacecraft was designed to map chlorophyll concentration in water,\nsediment distribution, gelbstoffe concentrations as a salinity\nindicator, and temperature of coastal waters and ocean\ncurrents. Reflected solar energy was measured in six channels to sense\ncolor caused by absorption due to chlorophyll, sediments, and\ngelbstoffe in coastal waters. The CZCS was a multi-channel scanning\nradiometer which used a rotating plane mirror at a 45 degree angle to\nthe optic axis of a Cassegran telescope. The mirror scanned 360\ndegrees but only the 80 degrees of data centered on nadir were\ncollected for ocean color measurements. The instrument viewed deep\nspace and calibration sources during the remainder of the scan. The\nincoming radiation was collected by the telescope and divided into two\nstreams by a dichroic beam splitter. One stream was transmitted to a\nfield stop that was also the entrance aperature of a small\npolychromator. The radiance that entered the polychromator was\nseperated and re-imaged in five wavelengths on five silicon detectors\nin the focal plane of the polychromator. The other stream was directed\nto a cooled mercury cadmium telluride detector in the thermal region\n(10.5-12.5 micrometer). A radiative cooler was used to cool the\nthermal detector. To avoid sun glint, the scanner mirror was tilted\nabout the sensor pitch axis on command so that the line of sight of\nthe sensor was moved in 2-deg increments up to 20 deg with respect to\nthe nadir.  Spectral bands at 0.443 and 0.670 micrometers centered on\nthe most intense absorption bands of chlorophyll, while the band at\n0.550 micrometers centered on the \"hinge point,\" the wavelength of\nminimum absorption. Ratios of measured energies in these channels were\nshown to closely parallel surface chlorophyll concentrations. Data\nfrom the scanning radiometer were processed, with algorithms developed\nfrom the field experiment data, to produce maps of chlorophyll\nabsorption. The temperatures of coastal waters and ocean currents were\nmeasured in a spectral band centered at 11.5 micrometers. Observations\nwere made also in two other spectral bands, 0.520 micrometers for\nchlorophyll correlation and 0.750 micrometers for surface vegetation.\nThe scan width was 1556 km centered on nadir and the ground resolution\nwas 0.825 km at nadir.  For a more detailed description, see Section 2\nin \"The Nimbus 7 Users' Guide\" (TRF B30045), available from\nNSSDC. Data are archived at SDSD.  Since mid-1984, the instrument\nexperienced occasional start-up problems. It was finally turned off in\nDecember 1986.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: CZCS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Imaging Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Short_Name: CZCS\n      Long_Name: Coastal Zone Color Scanner\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/CZCS/\n   Online_Resource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coastal_Zone_Color_Scanner\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

EA consists of two nested sets of quadrispherical electrostatic\nanalyzers. The inner analyzer measures electrons in the energy range from 6--36\neV, and the outer one measures positive ions from 7 eV/Q to 42 keV/Q. The field\nof view for each quadrispherical analyzer covers 10 degrees by 145 degrees,\nwhere the longer dimension is parallel to the satellite spin axis.\n\nLEP-SW measures three-dimensional velocity distributions of solar wind ions in\nthe energy range from 0.1--8 keV/Q with a 270 degree spherical electrostatic\nanalyzer with a field of view of 5 degrees by 60 degrees.\n\nLEP-MS is an energetic ion mass spectrometer, which provides three-dimensional\ndeterminations of the ion composition in 32 steps over the energy range of\n0--25 keV/Q. All sensors operate continuously as long as the spacecraft power\nbudget can allow, except for the orbit/attitude maneuvering operation.\n\nWhen spacecraft power budget is not sufficient to fully operate the\ninstruments, priority is given to LEP-EA and LEP-E.\n\nAlthough this experiment ceased operation shortly after launch, the LEP-EA and\nLEP-SW portions of the experiment resumed operation in late 1993 and have\nworked well ever since.\n\nPrincipal Investigator:\nDr. Tsugunobu Nagai\nTokyo Institue of Technology\nEarth and Planetary Sciences\nTokyo 152-8551  Japan\nPhone:\nFax:\ne-mail: nagai@geo.titech.ac.jp\n\nSee:\nhttp://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/geotail_inst.shtml\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: LEP\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Solar/Space Observing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Particle Detectors\n      Short_Name: LEP\n      Long_Name: Low Energy Particles (Geotail)\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: GEOTAIL\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/geotail_inst.shtml#LEP\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 1992-07-24\n      Instrument_Owner: ISAS, Japan\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

The TIP instruments complement the ionospheric capabilities of the GPS occultation experiment (GOX) by characterizing horizontal ionospheric density gradients. These photometers target OI 135.6 nm emission produced by ionospheric O++e recombination and measure ionospheric structure with a horizontal resolution of 10 – 30 km and sensitivity of greater than 300 counts/s/Rayleigh. The satellites initially orbited in the same plane at 450 km, but over the course of 13 months they are individually raised to their final 750~km orbits in six planes separated by 24° in right ascension. This deployment period provides opportunities for cross-calibration among the sensors, for multi-pass observations as the satellites orbit together early in the mission, and for observations at different spatial resolutions as the spacecraft operate at different altitudes. TIP data and basic Level 1 data products are processed and disseminated by the COSMIC Data Analysis and Archive Center (CDAAC) at UCAR and the Taiwan Analysis Center for COSMIC (TACC). Additionally, advanced algorithms and higher-level data products are generated and disseminated by the TIP operations center at NRL, including ionospheric morphology products, simple ionospheric electron densities, and combined GOX/TIP data products. COSMIC data will also be incorporated into the Utah State University Global Assimilation of Ionospheric Measurements (GAIM) model operating at NRL.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: TIP\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Photon/Optical Detectors\n      Instrument_Subtype: Photometers\n      Short_Name: TIP\n      Long_Name: Tiny Atmospheric Photometer\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: COSMIC/FORMOSAT-3\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 135.6 nm\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://ams.confex.com/ams/87ANNUAL/techprogram/paper_120405.htm\n   Online_Resource: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2004AGUSMSA51A..01F\n   Online_Resource: http://www.cosmic.ucar.edu/\n   Online_Resource: http://cosmic-io.cosmic.ucar.edu/cdaac/\n   Creation_Date: 2009-10-20\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: DOD/United States Naval Research Laboratory\n      Instrument_Owner: NSF/UCAR\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "The scientific objectives of the Ulysses Unified Radio and Plasma wave (URAP)\nexperiment are twofold: l) the determination of the direction, angular size,\nand polarization of radio sources for remote sensing of the heliosphere and the\nJovian magnetosphere and 2) the detailed study of local wave phenomena, which\ndetermine the transport coefficients of the ambient plasma. The tracking of\nsolar radio bursts, for example, can provide three dimensional \"snapshots\" of\nthe large scale magnetic field configuration along which the solar exciter\nparticles propagate. URAP observations of Jovian radio emissions should greatly\nimprove the determination of source locations and consequently our\nunderstanding of the generation mechanism(s) of planetary radio emissions. The\nstudy of observed wave-particle interactions will improve our understanding of\nthe processes that occur in the solar wind and at Jupiter and of radio wave\ngeneration. A brief discussion of the scientific goals of the experiment is\nfollowed by a comprehensive description of the instrument. The URAP sensors\nconsist of a 72.5 m electric field antenna in the spin plane, a 7.5-m electric\nfield monopole along the spin axis and a pair of orthogonal search coil\nmagnetic antennas. The various receivers, designed to encompass specific needs\nof the investigation, cover the frequency range from DC to l MHz. A relaxation\nsounder provides very accurate electron density measurements. Radio and plasma\nwave observations are shown to demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of\nthe URAP instruments: radio observations include solar bursts, auroral\nkilometric radiation, and Jovian bursts; plasma waves include Langmuir waves,\nion acoustic-like noise and whistlers.\n\n(Abstract from: R.G.

        skos:definition  "[Source: NASA POES Project home page, http://goespoes.gsfc.nasa.gov ]\n \nThe HIRS/4 is an atmospheric sounding instrument that provides multi-spectral data from one visible channel (0.69 micron), seven shortwave channels (3.7 to4.6 microns), and 12 longwave channels (6.7 to 15 microns) using a single telescope and a rotating filter wheel containing 20 individual spectral filters. The IFOV for each channel is approximately 7.0 ° that, from a spacecraft altitude of 870 km (470 nmi), encompasses a circular area of 10 km (6.2 mi) in diameter at nadir on Earth. This is an improvement in resolution over the 20-km (12.4 mi) HIRS/3 instrument that was flown on NOAA-KLM. An elliptical scan mirror provides a cross-track scan of 56 steps of 1.8° each. The mirror steps rapidly, then holds at each position while the optical radiation passing through 20 spectral filters is sampled. Each Earth scan takes 6.4 seconds and covers ±49.5° from nadir. IR calibration of the HIRS/4 is provided by views of space and the internal warm target, each viewed once per 38 Earth scans.\n\nThe instrument measures scene radiance in the IR spectrum. Data from the instrument is used, in conjunction with the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU) instruments, to calculate the atmosphere’s vertical temperature profile from the Earth’s surface to about 40 km (24.9 mi) altitude. The data is also used to determine ocean surface temperatures, total atmospheric ozone levels, precipitable water, cloud height and coverage, and surface radiance.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: HIRS/4\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Profilers/Sounders\n      Short_Name: HIRS/4\n      Long_Name: High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder/4\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: NOAA-19\n      Short_Name: NOAA-18\n      Short_Name: METOP-A\n      Short_Name: METOP-B\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Infrared > Thermal\n      Number_Channels: 19\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 14.96 μm - 3.76 μm\n      Spectral_Frequency_Resolution: 669 cm-1  - 2,660 cm-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Near Infrared\n      Number_Channels: 1\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.690 μm\n      Spectral_Frequency_Resolution: 14,500 cm-1\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www.esa.int/esaLP/SEMUREG23IE_LPmetop_0.html\n   Online_Resource: http://www2.ncdc.noaa.gov/docs/klm/html/c3/sec3-2.htm\n   Online_Resource: http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/99871.pdf\n   Online_Resource: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/pod-guide/ncdc/docs/klm/html/j/app-j2.htm\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-21\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: EUMETSAT\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NOAA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

In view of the project’s aim to demonstrate technology, several platform elements and systems have also been included as technology experiments.\n\nThe Proba-1 development approach includes several innovative aspects. A design-to-cost approach was adopted according to European Cooperation for Space Standardisation category 3 project classification. This involved using COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) equipment and units; simulation-based development, verification and testing; automated software generation; extensive use of test and operations infrastructure commonalities; and a highly integrated ESA-industry design and development team.\n\nExtensive use is made of automated functions onboard the spacecraft. Full onboard flight dynamics computation, in conjunction with automated ground segment functions such as pass automation and high-level user interfaces, satisfy the spacecraft autonomy requirements.\n\nAutomated functions onboard handle nominal spacecraft operations, plan and schedule activities, and manage payload resources. Onboard flight dynamics include orbital navigation as well as computation and control of instruments, camera pointing and scanning in order to meet user-defined targets (latitude, longitude and altitude).\n\nSummary provided by http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Proba_web_site/ESARBKTHN6D_0.html\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: PASS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Photon/Optical Detectors\n      Instrument_Subtype: Cameras\n      Short_Name: PASS\n      Long_Name: Payload Autonomous Star Sensor\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: PROBA-1\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Proba_web_site/ESARBKTHN6D_0.html\n   Sample_Image: http://www.esa.int/images/Ardennes_M.jpg\n   Creation_Date: 2011-01-10\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

A comparison of the signals from\nthe open aperture detector and the masked aperture detector is used to accept\nonly those particles passing through the center of the laser beam. The index of\nrefraction of individual particles can be estimated from the ratio of the\nforward to back scatter signals. A calibration diode laser is pulsed\nperiodically during flight to ensure proper operation of the electronics.

        skos:definition  "      The objectives of the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV) flown on\n      NIMBUS-7 were to determine the vertical distribution of ozone, map the\n      total ozone content, and monitor the incident solar ultraviolet (UV)\n      irradiance and ultraviolet radiation backscattered from the earth. The\n      SBUV consisted of a double Ebert-Fastie spectrometer and a filter\n      photometer similar to the BUV on Nimbus 4. The SBUV spectrometer\n      measured solar UV backscattered by the earth's atmosphere at 12\n      wavelengths between 0.25 and 0.34 micrometer, with a spectral bandpass\n      of 0.001 micrometer. The SBUV used three detectors: a photomultiplier\n      tube (PMT) and a photodiode for the monochromator, and one photodiode\n      for the photometer. Both the monochromator and the photometer have\n      chopper wheels operating at 25 Hz.  The SBUV used a depolarizer to\n      eliminate the sensitivity of the grating monochromator to polarization\n      of the backscattered radiation. The instrument's field of view (FOV)\n      at nadir was 0.20 rad. A roughened aluminum diffuser plate viewed the\n      sun for solar-spectral irradiance measurements and for calibration by\n      viewing a mercury-argon lamp. The diffuser plate was driven by a\n      stepper motor to three postions on command: SBUV, TOMS, and STOW. The\n      contribution functions for the eight shortest wavelengths were\n      centered at levels ranging from 55 to 28 km and were used to infer the\n      vertical ozone profile. The four longest wavelengths had contribution\n      functions in the troposphere which were used to compute the total\n      ozone amount. The SBUV spectrometer had a second mode of operation\n      that allowed a continuous solar-spectral scan from 0.16 to 0.4\n      micrometer for detailed examination of the extraterrestrial solar\n      spectrum and its temporal variations. A parallel photometer channel at\n      0.343 micrometer measured the reflectivity of the atmosphere's lower\n      boundary in the same 0.21-rad FOV.\n      A another version of the SBUV (SBUV/2) has been flown on the NOAA\n      Polar Orbiting series of spacecraft on NOAA-9, NOAA-11, and NOAA-14.m\n      The SBUV/2 was a non-scanning, nadir viewing instrument designed to\n      measure scene radiance in the spectral region from 160 to 400 nm. SBUV\n      data are used to determine the vertical distribution of and total\n      ozone in the atmosphere, and solar spectral irradiance.\n\n      Additional Information:\n\nSBUV sensor: \"http://www.eumetsat.de/en/index.html?area=left2.html&body\n=/en/area2/cgms/ap10-12.htm&a=284&b=2&c=280&d=200&e=0\"\n\n      TOMS: \"http://jwocky.gsfc.nasa.gov/\"\n\n\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "A scatterometer transmits radar pulses and receives backscattered energy, the intensity of which depends on the roughness and dielectric properties of a particular target. Scatterometers were originally designed to measure oceanic surface winds, where the amount of backscatter depends on two factors  the size of the surface ripples on the ocean, and their orientation with respect to the propagation direction of the pulse of radiation transmitted by the scatterometer. The first is dependent on wind stress and hence wind speed at the surface, while the second is related to wind direction. Hence measurements by such scatterometers may be used to derive both wind speed and direction.\n\nThese instruments aim to achieve high accuracy measurements of wind vectors (speed and direction) and resolution is of secondary importance (they generally produce wind maps with a resolution of order 25-50km). Because scatterometers operate at microwave wavelengths, the measurements are available irrespective of weather conditions.\n\nSpaceborne scatterometers have provided continuous synoptic microwave coverage of the Earth for nearly a decade, starting with the ERS series, NSCAT on ADEOS, and more recently SeaWinds on QuikSCAT. The ERS and NSCAT instruments employed a fan-beam (multi-incidence) wind retrieval technique, whereas QuikSCAT employs a conically scanning (fixed incidence) technique. Increases in swath width capability of scatterometers now mean that a single instrument can provide around 90% coverage of global oceans on a daily basis.\n\n[Summary provided by CEOS.]\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: SCATTEROMETERS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Active Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Scatterometers\n      Short_Name: SCATTEROMETERS\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www.eohandbook.com/eohb05/ceos/part3_1_pop13.html\n   Creation_Date: 2007-09-12\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

To progress toward these\ngoals, the UVCS will perform ultraviolet spectroscopy and visible polarimetry\nto be combined with plasma diagnostic analysis techniques to provide detailed\nempirical descriptions of the extended solar corona from the coronal base to a\nheliocentric height of 12 solar radii. \n(from: http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/uvcs/uvcspap/uvcspap.html)\n\nFor more information, see:\nhttp://cfa-www.harvard.edu/uvcs/uvcs.html\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: UVCS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Solar/Space Observing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Ultraviolet Instruments\n      Short_Name: UVCS\n      Long_Name: Ultraviolet Coronograph Spectrometer\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: SOHO\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Ultraviolet\n      Number_Channels: 3\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 610 -6000 A\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/uvcs/\n   Sample_Image: http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/uvcs/mos/mos2.jpg\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 1995-12-02\n      Instrument_Owner: Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "\nMost imaging radars used for remote sensing are side-looking\nairborne radars (SLARs). The antenna points to the side with a\nbeam that is wide vertically and narrow horizontally. The image\nis produced by motion of the aircraft past the area being\ncovered.\n\nA short pulse is transmitted from the airborne radar, when the\npulse strikes a target of some kind, a signal returns to the\naircraft. The time delay associated with this received signal,\nas with other pulse radars, gives the distance between target\nand radar.\n\nWhen a single pulse is transmitted, the return signal can be\ndisplayed on an oscilloscope; however, this does not allow the\nproduction of an image. Hence, in the imaging radar, the signal\nreturn is used to modulate the intensity of the beam on the\noscilloscope, rather than to display it vertically in proportion\nto the signal strength.\n\nThus, a single intensity-modulated line appears on the\noscilloscope, and is transferred by a lens to a film. The film\nis in the form of a strip that moves synchronously with the\nmotion of the aircraft, so that as the aircraft moves forward\nthe film also moves.\n\nWhen the aircraft has moved one beamwidth forward, the return\nsignals come from a different strip on the ground. These signals\nintensity-modulate the line on the cathode-ray tube and produce\na different image on a line on the film adjacent to the original\nline. As the aircraft moves forward, a series of these lines is\nimaged onto the film, and the result is a two-dimensional\npicture of the radar return from the surface.\n\nThe speed of the film is adjusted so that the scales of the\nimage in the directions perpendicular to and along the flight\ntrack are maintained as nearly identical to each other as\npossible. Because the cross-track dimension in the image is\ndetermined by a time measurement, and the time measurement is\nassociated with the direct distance (slant range) from the radar\nto the point on the surface, the map is distorted somewhat by\nthe difference between the slant range and the horizontal\ndistance, or ground range.\n\nIn some radar systems, this distortion is removed by making the\nsweep on the cathode-ray tube nonlinear, so that the points are\nmapped in their proper ground range relationship. This, however,\nonly applies exactly if the points all lie in a plane surface,\nand this modification can result in excessive distortion in\nmountainous areas.\n\nSide-looking airborne radars normally are divided into two\ngroups: the real-aperture systems that depend on the beamwidth\ndetermined by the actual antenna, and the synthetic aperture\nsystems that depend upon signal processing to achieve a much\nnarrower beamwidth in the along-track direction than that\nattainable with the real antenna.  The customary nomenclature\nused is \"SLAR\" for the real-aperture system and \"SAR\" for the\nsynthetic aperture system, although the latter is also a\nside-looking airborne (or spaceborne) radar.\n\n[Source: ESA]\n\n"@en ;

The objective of this experiment was to obtain vertical temperature and water vapor profiles of the atmosphere to support Department of Defense requirements in operational weather analysis and forecasting. The SSE was an eigth-channel sensor with six channels (668.5, 677, 695, 708, 725, and 747 cm-1) in the carbon dioxide 15 micrometer absorption band, one channel (535 cm-1) in a water vapor absorption band, and one channel (835 cm-1) in the 11 micrometer atmospheric window. The experiment consisted of an optical system, detector and associated electronics, and a scanning mirror. The scanning mirror stepped across the satellite subtrack, allowing the SSE to view 25 separate columns of the atmosphere every 32 sec over a cross track ground swath of 185 km. While the scanning mirror was stopped at a scene station, the channel filters were totaled through the field of view. The surface resolution of the SSE was approximately 37 km at nadir. The carbon dioxide band radiation data were transformed to a temperature profile by a mathematical inversion technique. By a similar technique, this information could be combined with water vapor band data to obtain a water vapor profile.

It is towed from a tow\npoint placed in a cut in the centre line from the leading edge of the fish\nbody. This tow point allows the cable to pivot ± 90° about a transverse axis\njust forward of the centre of lift providing maximum control while ensuring\nvery good pitch stability resulting in an excellent symmetrical saw tooth\nprofile.\n\nTo give the control system feedback for the flap control, the ScanFish is\nequipped with pitch and roll sensors together with feedback sensors on the\nflaps. The feedback is also used to control the fish, so that it always flies\nin a horizontal position - without roll - and during launch to ensure that the\nfish turns itself upright and level, in case the fish was \"flipped over\" when\nlowered into the water.\n\nThis instrument may carry a number of sensors measuring parameters like \nconductivity (salinity), temperature, pressure, fluorescence, \nphotosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and other parameters.  \n\n[Summary adapted from http://www.eiva.dk/sw316.asp]\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "\nThe High Resolution Telescope and Spectrograph (HRTS) instrument was\nsuccessfully launched on Sept. 30, 1997 from LC-36 at the White Sands\nMissile Range. The instrument consists of 30cm Cassegrain telescope\nand a three element focal plane package. The central focal plane\ninstrument was a tandem Wadsworth spectrograph with wavelength\ncoverage in two bands (120-140nm and 150-170nm) with a resolution of\n50mAngstroms. The reflective spectrograph slit jaws are imaged with an\nintermediate bandpass UV spectroheliograph and with a visible Halpha\nimaging slit jaw imaging system. As on the previous flight, four\n(20Angstrom FWHM) filters were used in the spectroheliograph to obtain\nimages with central wavelengths at 1540, 1550, 1560 and 1600\nAngstroms. The spectra and images are recorded on photographic\nfilm. The instrument was successfully pointed and focussed in\nflight. 1 arc-second spatial resolution was achieved in all the\nimages.\n\nThe observation target for the mission was the coronal hole at the\nsolar north pole. During the prime mission, the 900\" long slit\nwas moved over the surface of the sun to obtain a 10\" wide\nraster with 2\" steps. The slit was positioned nearly radially\nwith 100\" above the northern limb of the sun. A wide range of\nexposures were taken to observe a wide variety of bright and\nfaint lines. A series of spectroheliograph and Halpha images\nwere taken of the spectrograph slit jaws to reference the slit\nlocation. Final image coregistration will be accomplished using\nslit jaw, Tmin continuum images and Kitt Peak/MDI\nmagnetograms. An excellent collaborative data set was obtained\nat Kitt Peak Observatory (chromospheric and photospheric\nmagnetograms), Big Bear Solar Observatory and University of\nHawaii. The space based collaborative observing campaign\nincluded SXT (YOHKOH), MDI (SOHO), EIT (SOHO), CDS (SOHO) and\nSUMER (SOHO). The slit spectra show an interesting collection\nof explosive even ts in C IV. The spectroheliograph images show\nC IV loop like structures near the limb.\n\nThe flight also was the first scientific flight of the new digital\nattitude control system produced by the Lockheed Martin SPARCS group\nat the White Sands Missile Range. The system utilizes fast,\nprogrammable digital control of the payload. The previous problem of\nground loop noise on the shielded sensor lines was entirely eliminated\nby the incorporation of a fiber optic sensor data line. The\nperformance of this new system was superb. Acquisition occurred within\n30 seconds of opening the aperture door. The noise on the sensor\noutput lines was 0.05 arc-seconds. The stability over the entire\nflight was 1.5 arc-seconds peak to peak. The stability of the pointing\nover a typical 10 second exposure was 0.2 arc-seconds peak to peak and\n<0.1 arc-seconds peak to peak for a typical 1 second exposure. This\npointing stability in future flights will enable very high spatial\nresolution solar images to be obtained from a sounding rocket\nplatform.\n\n      Additional information available at\n      \"http://wwwsolar.nrl.navy.mil/hrts.html\"\n\n      {Summary provided by Naval Research Laboratory}\n\n\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "SOFIE is one of three instruments onboard the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) satellite. The objective of AIM is to study polar mesospheric clouds (PMCs) and the environment in which they form.\n\nSOFIE uses the technique of solar occultation to measure solar energy passing through the limb of the earth's atmosphere as the sun rises or sets relative to the spacecraft. These measurements are accomplished using differential absorption radiometry with eight band pairs covering wavelengths from 0.29 to 5.26 microns. Six SOFIE channels are designed to measure gaseous signals, and two are dedicated to PMC measurements.  Measurements in two carbon dioxide bands will be used to simultaneously retrieve profiles of temperature and carbon dioxide mixing ratio. Each SOFIE channel uses two detectors, one that samples a spectral region where the target gas is strongly absorbing, and one that samples a weakly absorbing region. Measuring the difference of these signals allows precise isolation of the target gas signal and reduces common-mode noise. The measurements allow PMC extinction retrievals using the gas channel weak bands, so that PMCs will be measured at a total of 11 wavelengths. \n\n[Text Source: GATS Inc.

        skos:definition  "The Cloud Lidar System (CLS), which was operated from the left ER2 superpod, measured the backscatter cross-sections of cloud and aerosol particles at 1.064 and 0.532 microns. It was used in the TOGA/COARE experiment primarily to profile clouds below the flight level of the aircraft which was typically 18.0-20.5 km. In cases where the cloud optical thicknesses were small, boundary layer aerosol backscatter signals were detectable. The  0.532 micron lidar return was split into signals that were  parallel and perpendicular to the outgoing laser radiation,  thereby providing polarization sensitive data principally for  cloud particle phase state detection. The cloud lidar provided  information on the internal vertical structure of optically  thin clouds which aids in the determination of the overall  influence of such clouds on the radiative balance in both the  shortwave and longwave portions of the spectrum. Another  principal application that was planned for the ER2 CLS was the  study of radiative heating and cooling rates for tropical  cirrus. The CLS provided a detailed picture of internal cloud  structure which aided in the interpretation of visible,  infrared, and microwave radiometric data when they are applied  to the determination of radiative fluxes and forcing. The lidar  signal was useful up to a maximum optical thickness of 3 to  4. It provided the locations of cloud layer boundaries, both  vertically and horizontally, which was useful in most types of  cloud studies.  The CLS can provide information on cloud  particle characteristics. Depolarization of the laser pulses  detected at the green wavelenghts can reveal water phase state  of the particles. CLS backscatter information, when combined  with multispectral radiometric observations, can be used in the  determination particle size and concentration within the  clouds.   The lidar also gathered data on boundary layer heights and  aerosol backscatter cross-sections. From the distribution of  cloud base heights in and around the marine boundary layer, an  estimate of the LCL (lifting condensation level) can be  obtained. When combined with the sea surface temperature this  could provide a measure of the moisture content. From the  intensity of the lidar return, estimates of cloud liquid water  are possible.   \n\n[Summary provided by NASA]\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: CLS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Active Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Profilers/Sounders\n      Instrument_Subtype: Lidar/Laser Sounders\n      Short_Name: CLS\n      Long_Name: Cloud Lidar System\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: NASA ER-2\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

Two of these\nsphere pairs are in the satellite spin plane on the ends of wire booms that\nprovide tip to tip sphere separations of 100 and 130 meters respectively, while\nthe third pair is aligned along the spacecraft spin axis with a 14 meter tip to\ntip separation that is provided by rigid stacer booms.\n\nThe electric field preamplifiers have frequency responses to above one mHz to\naccommodate their use by the Plasma Wave Instrument. In addition, the Electric\nField Instrument interfaces on the spacecraft with the Magnetic Field\nExpirement (which provides information for deciding when to trigger bursts of\ndata collection), the Hydra plasma experiment (in order that both instruments\ncollect high time resolution data simultaneously), and the low energy plasma\nexperiment, Tide, (which wants to know when the Electric Field Instrument is\ncollecting data in the burst mode).\n\nThe heritage for the Electric Field Instrument encompasses instruments\npreviously flown on the S3-3, GEOS, ISEE-1, Viking, and CRRES satellites, as\nwell as experiments being built for the Freja, FAST, and Cluster satellites. \n\nHarvey, P., F.

        skos:definition  "[Text Source: NASA Science Mission Directorate, http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/moms ]\n\nThe Modular Optoelectronic Multispectral Scanner (MOMS) is a scanning system (based on CCD technique) for airborne and predominantly spaceborne geoscientific remote sensing application. The first version MOMS-01 (with a dual channel mode: 600 nm and 900 nm) has been developed by order of the German Minister for Research and Technology under contract from the German Aerospace Research Establishment (DLR, previous DFVLR)by Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm (MBB). Scientific guidance for the experiment has been provided by the University of Munich/FRG.\n\nMost important characteristic of MOMS is the modular arrangement of the CCD-sensor, electronics, optical lens system and filters that allow the instrument to be adapted for completely different geoscientific tasks or missions, as well as the refurbishment of the system between missions as demonstrated in practise.\n\nThe multispectral mode of the MOMS family envisages geoscientific data application for: general geologic mapping, mineral resources exploration, hydrology; mapping and monitoring of renewable resources (agriculture, forestry, urban and regional planning); coastal zone monitoring; topographic mapping with conventional methods.\n\nThe first two flights of the space qualified MOMS-01 took place on board of Space Shuttle with the missions STS-7 in June 1983 (total recording time: 26 min) and STS-11 in February 1984 (total recording time: 30 min). The sensor was placed with magtape recording unit (HDDT) on the SPAS-01 platform, built by MBB, which was loosely connected to the Shuttle by a specific bus system for system control. Both flights yielded high-resolution images with 20x20 m ground pixel size from about 300 km orbital altitude. Data takes are available over Africa/Arabia, Australia, East Asia, India, South America, South East Asia, and USA.\n\nData processing, archiving of products and their distribution to users is made by the German Remote Data Center (DFD) in Oberpfaffenhofen, FRG. Data products include CCT copies (1600,6250 bpi), film negatives and B/W paper copies (scale1:800000) and appropriate image enlargements.

The AVNIR-2 provides 10-meter spatial resolution images compared with the 16 m resolution of the AVNIR in the multi spectral region. The higher resolution was realized by improving the CCD detectors (AVNIR: 5,000 pixels per CCD, AVNIR-2: 7,000 pixels per CCD) and their electronics.

Radiation incident on the beamsplitter from\none of the two \"ports\" is then divided into two parts, each of\nwhich propagates down one of the two arms and is reflected off\none of the mirrors. The two beams are then recombined and\ntransmitted out the other port. When the position of one mirror\nis continuously varied along the axis of the corresponding arm,\nan interference pattern is swept out as the two phase-shifted\nbeams interfere with each other.\n\nAdditional information available at\n\"http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/FourierTransformSpectrometer.\nhtml\"\n\n[Summary provided by Science World]\n"@en ;

The EUV radiation includes the 0.1-105 nm range, which provides the majority of the energy for heating Earth's thermosphere and creating Earth's ionosphere (ionized plasma). This wide spectral range requies the use of multiple channels. Some key requirements for EVE are to measure the solar EUV irradiance spectrum with 0.1 nm spectral resolution and with 20 sec cadence. These drive the EVE design to include grating spectrographs with array detectors so that all EUV wavelengths can be measured simultaneously. Another key requirement for EVE is to measure the EUV radiation with an accuracy of 25% or better, thus on-board calibration channels are included to go with underflight calibration experiments to be conducted during the SDO mission.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: EVE-SDO\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Solar/Space Observing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Ultraviolet Instruments\n      Short_Name: EVE-SDO\n      Long_Name: Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment on Solar Dynamics Observatory\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: SDO\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Ultraviolet\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.1 nm -105 nm\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://lasp.colorado.edu/eve/\n   Online_Resource: http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/mission/instruments.php\n   Sample_Image: http://lasp.colorado.edu/eve/images/instrument/EVE_FrontOpen_Labels_sm.jpg\n   Creation_Date: 2009-04-24\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

Both (1) fixed\nwide-angle sampling of terrestrial fluxes at the satellite altitude\nand (2) scanned narrow-angle sampling of the angular radiance\ncomponents, were used to determine outgoing radiation (reflected and\nemitted). The ERB subsystem consisted of a 22-channel radiometer\ncontaining separate subassemblies to perform the required solar,\nearth-flux (wide angle), and scanned earth radiance (narrow angle)\nmeasurements. The systems used optical filters for spectral\ndiscriminations, and for uncooled thermal detectors, thermopile\ndetectors in the solar and fixed-earth-flux channels, and pyroelectric\ndetectors in the scanning channels. The 10 solar channels observed the\nsun in front of the observatory in the X-Y plane. The solar channels\nobtained usable solar data only during a period of about 3 min in each\norbit when the spacecraft was over the Antarctic region. Their full\nresponse field of view (FOV) was 0.18 rad. The solar channel\nsubassembly was pivoted plus or minus 0.35 rad in the X-Y plane to\ncompensate for sun-angle deviation when required. The channel 10c\nsolar channel was a model H-F self-calibrating cavity thermopile used\nfor monitoring the total solar irradiance (0.2 to 50 micrometers). The\nfour fixed earth-flux channels (numbered 11-14) were mounted so that\nthey could continuously view the total earth disk, and record data at\n0.25-s intervals.  The eight narrow FOV scanning channels were mounted\nin the scanning head.  The NFOV channels consisted of four shortwave\n(0.2 to 4.8 micrometers) and four longwave (4.5 to 50+ micrometers)\nchannels. The scanning head was gimbal-mounted in the radiometer unit\nmain frame. The FOVs of the telescopes were asymmetric (4.4 by 89.4\nmrad) and those of the shortwave and longwave channels were\ncoincident. The 89.4 mrad FOVs of the four pairs of channels were not\ncontiguous, but covered only alternate 89.4 mrad angular intervals\nalong the horizon.\n\nContact Information:\n\nNASA Langley Research Center\nMail Stop 157D\n2 South Wright Street\nHampton, Virginia 23681-2199\nUSA\nTelephone: (757) 864-8656\nFAX: (757) 864-8807\nE-mail: larc&#64eos.nasa.gov\nIDN_Node: USA/NASA\n\nAdditional information available at\n\"http://charm.larc.nasa.gov/GUIDE/campaign_documents/nimbus7_project.html\"\n\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "GRAS (Global Navigation Satellite System Receiver for Atmospheric Sounding) is a new European GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) receiver that operates as an atmospheric sounder. It will provide unprecedented observations of atmospheric temperature and humidity to improve weather forecasting and climate change monitoring.\n\nGRAS uses radio occultation to measure vertical profiles of atmospheric temperature and humidity by tracking signals received from a constellation of GPS navigation satellites while they are setting or rising behind the Earth's atmosphere. Radio occultation is based on the fact that when radio waves pass through the atmosphere, either during a rise event or during a set event as seen by the receiver, they are refracted along the atmospheric path. The degree of refraction depends on gradients of air density, which in turn depend on temperature and water vapour. Therefore, measurement of the refracted angle contains information about these atmospheric variables.\n \nAs the measurements are made tangentially to the atmosphere, the profiles will be provided with a resolution within a few hundred metres to 1.5 kilometres, while horizontal coverage of each profile is in the order of a few hundred kilometres. The GRAS instrument will provide 500 very precise atmospheric profiles per day, which will be fed into Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models to improve the accuracy of weather forecasts. At the same time, due to the very good stability of the instrument, GRAS measurements will contribute to monitoring climate change.\n \nGRAS can track up to eight satellites for navigation purposes, two additional satellites for rise and two others for set occultation measurements. GRAS has on-board GPS satellite prediction for optimising the navigation and occultation measurements. \n\nSource: ESA\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: GRAS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Positioning/Navigation\n      Instrument_Subtype: GPS\n      Short_Name: GRAS\n      Long_Name: Global navigation satellite system Receiver for Atmospheric Sounding\n   End_Group\n   Group: Instrument_Associated_Sensors\n      Short_Name: GPS SONDE\n      Short_Name: GRAS\n      Short_Name: GPS RECEIVERS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: METOP\n      Short_Name: METOP-A\n      Short_Name: METOP-B\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Radio\n      Number_Channels: 8\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://oiswww.eumetsat.org/WEBOPS/eps-pg/GRAS/GRAS-PG-0TOC.htm\n   Creation_Date: 2007-09-13\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Data_Rate: 60 kb/s\n      Instrument_Owner: ESA/Eumetsat\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

These observations will continue over the\nfull range of heliocentric distances and heliographic latitudes reached by the\nprobe after its encounter with Jupiter and consequent deflection out of the\necliptic plane. Solar wind electrons and ions are measured simultaneously with\nindependent curved-plate electrostatic analyzers equipped with multiple Channel\nElectron Multipliers (CEMs). The CEMs are arranged to detect particles at\nchosen polar angles from the spacecraft spin axis; resolution in spacecraft\nazimuth is obtained by timing measurements with the spacecraft Sun clock as the\nspacecraft spins. Electrons with central energies extending from 0.86 eV to 814\neV are detected at seven polar angles and various combinations of azimuth angle\nto cover the unit sphere comprehensively, so as to enable computation of the\npertinent electron velocity distribution parameters. As the average electron\nflux level changes with heliocentric distance, command control of the CEM\ncounting intervals is used to extend the dynamic range. Ions are detected\nbetween 255 eV/q and 34.4 keV/q using appropriate subsets of 16 CEMs at spin\nangles designed to provide matrices of counts as a function of energy per\ncharge, azimuth angle, and polar angle centered on the average direction of\nsolar-wind flow. Data matrices are obtained every 4 min when the spacecraft is\nactively transmitting and every 8 min during data store periods. These matrices\ncontain sufficient energy and angle resolution to permit a detailed\ncharacterization of the ion velocity distributions from which ion bulk\nparameters are derived. As the average ion flux intensity changes with\nheliocentric distance, the entrance aperture size is periodically optimized by\ncommand selection from a set of seven apertures on a disk driven by a stepping\nmotor. Changes in the average solar wind flow direction relative to the\nEarth-pointing spacecraft spin axis are accommodated by command selection of\nthe proper measurement matrix from a set of 11 matrices. In a separate mode of\noperation and under favorable conditions, heavy ions of oxygen, silicon, and\niron at various charge levels are resolved.\n\n(Abstract from: S.J. Bame et al., Astron.

        skos:definition  "The acoustic depth gauge (ADG) measures the distance from the gauge to the\nsnow. The distance to the snow surface in mm and the air temperature used to\ncalculate the speed of sound for the distance measurement are recorded in a\nmemory module at 1 hour intervals along with the hour and the Julian day of the\nyear. The snow accumulation is calculated by subtracting the ADG depth from the\ninitial distance to the snow. Figure 1 shows the June 1992 ADG record at the\ntime of installation. The July 1992 record shows that the snow surface may be\nexposed for long time periods without significant snow accumulation. Once the\nsnow surface is covered with additional snow without being exposed later the\nlayer can be considered stored. Sampling the previously exposed surface should\ngive an idea of the dry fall and sampling the snow between exposed layers\nshould give information about the wet fall. The accumulation between previously\nexposed layers may be precipitation or it could be snow trans ported to the\nsite. A similar approach is planned for Siple Dome and the new drilling site\nnear Byrd Station.\n\nAdditional information available at\nhttp://igloo.gsfc.nasa.gov/wais/pastmeetings/abstracts99/stearns.html\n\n[Summary provided by NASA]\n"@en ;

NASA/JPL currently maintain and operate an airborne SAR\nsystem, known as AIRSAR/TOPSAR, which flies on a NASA DC-8 jet. In one\nmode of operation, this system is capable of simultaneously collecting\nall four polarizations (HH,HV, VH and VV) for three frequencies: L-\nband (lambda ~ 24 cm); C-band (lambda ~ 6 cm) ; and P-band (lambda ~\n68 cm). In another mode of operation, the AIRSAR/TOPSAR system\ncollects all four polarizations (HH,HV, VH and VV) for two\nfrequencies: L- band (lambda ~ 24 cm); and P-band (lambda ~ 68 cm),\nwhile operating as an interferometer at C-band to simultaneously\ngenerate topographic height data.  AIRSAR/TOPSAR also has an\nalong-track interferometer mode which is used to measure current\nspeeds. Typical image sizes for AIRSAR/TOPSAR products are 12kmx12km,\nwith 10 meter resolution in both dimensions. Topographic map products\ngenerated by the TOPSAR system have been shown to have a height\naccuracy of 1 m in relatively flat areas, and 5 m height accuracy in\nmountainous areas.\n\n\nFor more information on AirSAR or AirSAR data products and imagery, see:\n\"http://airsar.jpl.nasa.gov\"\n\nRadar Data Center\nMail Stop 300 - 233\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\n4800 Oak Grove Drive\nPasadena, CA 91109\nFax: (818) 393 2640\ne-mail: radar.data@jpl.nasa.gov\n\n\"http://southport.jpl.nasa.gov\"\n\n"@en ;

The overlap region where the two laser beams intersect defines an area where two orthogonal views of particles are obtained, which improves sample volume boundaries and sizing of small (less than 100 μm) particles as compared to conventional optical array probes. The use of two high-speed, 128-photodiode linear arrays allows the 2D-S probe to produce shadowgraph particle images with 10-μm pixel resolution at aircraft speeds up to 250 m s−1. The stereo views of particles in the overlap region can also improve determination of the three-dimensional shape of a particle. Features of this probe are:\n\n- Has two 128-photodiode linear arrays working independently as high-speed and high-resolution optical imaging probes.\n\n- Captures two-dimensional images of particles passing through the sample volume where laser beams overlap.\n\n- The region where the beams overlap uniquely defines the depth-of-field (and thus the sample volume) for small particles.\n\n- Response time is 10 times faster than older probes.\n\n- Particles as small as 10 microns imaged at 200 m/s.\n\n- Greatly improved determination of sample volume and sizing of small particles less than 100 microns.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: PMS 2D-S PROBE\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: In Situ/Laboratory Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Chemical Meters/Analyzers\n      Short_Name: PMS 2D-S PROBE\n      Long_Name: Particle Measuring Systems 2D-S Probe\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: BEECHCRAFT KING AIR\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Spectral_Frequency_Resolution: 10 microns\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://ghrc.nsstc.nasa.gov/uso/ds_docs/gpmgv/lpvex/gpmcilpvex/gpmcilpvex_dataset.html\n   Creation_Date: 2011-03-01\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "\nThe The Synchronous Orbit Particle Analyzer (SOPA) instrument is\ndesigned to provide high spatial, high-resolution energetic\nparticle measurements at geo-synchronous orbit on spinning\nsatellites. As such it monitors electrons, protons, helium,\ncarbon, nitrogen, and oxygen ions individually and all particles\nwith Z > sulfur and all particles with Z > strontium above\ncertain energies. Finally, the SOPA E by dE/dx capability is\nexploited to provide dual parameter pulse height analysis\n(PHA). This feature extends the ion coverage, in principal, to\nall ions. The SOPA instrument, because it collects many samples\nof the surrounding particle populations (64 per spin period),\ncan be used to determine the symmetry axis of the distribution\nthus providing the magnetic field orientation. The reader is\nreferred to Belian, et al., 1992, for further information.\n\nThe instrument consists of three solid-state detector telescopes\n(T1, T2 and T3) that accept particles from three different\ndirections relative to the spacecraft spin axis. Each telescope\nconsists of a thin, 4 ?m, 10 mm2 front detector followed by a\nthick, 3000 ?m, 25 mm2 back detector. A collimator, with 11?\n(full width) field of view fronts the detector stack. High and\nlow Z passive shielding completely surround the active\nsolid-state detectors providing protection from side penetrating\nparticles. The shielding is sized to stop 50% of the 6 MeV\nelectrons and 65 MeV protons incident normal to the shielding\nsurface.\n\nAdditional information available at\n\"http://leadbelly.lanl.gov/psm/dickb.html\"\n\n[Summary provided by Leadbelly]\n\n\n"@en ;

Mounted on the earth-oriented sensory ring, the radiometer measured thermal radiation in the 3.5- to 4.1-micrometer \"window\" region. The HRIR subsystem consisted of (1) an optical system, (2) an infrared detector (lead selenide photoconductive material), (3) electronics, (4) a magnetic tape recorder, and (5) a filter to minimize attenuation effects of water vapor and carbon dioxide. In contrast to the AVCS camera, no image was formed within the radiometer. The HRIR sensor merely transformed the received radiation into an electrical voltage, which was recorded on the tape recorder for subsequent playback when the satellite came within range of an acquisition station. Some HRIR data were also transmitted in a real-time mode by the APT transmitter. The radiometer had an instantaneous field of view of about 0.5 deg, which at an altitude of 1100 km corresponded to a ground resolution of approximately 8 km at nadir. The radiometer was capable of measuring radiance temperatures from 210 to 330 K. Since it operated in the 3.5- to 4.1-micrometer region, the daytime pictures included reflected solar radiation in addition to the emitted surface IR radiation. However, the reflected solar radiation did not saturate the instrument, and a usable output was still obtained. The experiment was a success, and good data were obtained until the HRIR tape recorder failed on November 15, 1966. The failure of the spacecraft recorder on July 26, 1966, necessitated the use of the HRIR recorder on a part-time basis to record selected telemetry data, which resulted in a 15% reduction of available HRIR data thereafter.

The window channel provided an image of the cloud cover and temperatures of the cloud tops, land, and ocean surfaces. The other channel provided information on the moisture and cirrus cloud content of the upper troposphere and stratosphere, and the location of jet streams and frontal systems. The ground resolution at nadir was 6.7 km for the window channel and 20 km for the water vapor channel. Data from these two channels were used primarily to support other sophisticated meteorological experiments onboard Nimbus 7. The instrument was a non-imaging radiometer consisting of a 12.7 cm Cassegrain system and scanning mirror common to both channels, a beam splitter, filters, and two germanium-immersed thermistor bolometers. Incoming radiant energy was collected by a flat scanning mirror inclined at 45 deg to the optical axis. The mirror rotated through 360 deg at 48 rpm and scanned in a plane normal to the spacecraft velocity. The energy then was focused on a dichroic beam splitter which divided the energy spectrally and spatially. The two channels of this sensor transformed the received radiation into electric outputs (voltages), which were digitized and recorded on magnetic tape for subsequent playback to a ground acquisition station. For more complete information on instrument and data products, see Section 9 in \"The Nimbus 7 Users' Guide\" (TRF B30045) and the \"Nimbus 7 Temperature-Humidity Infrared Radiometer (THIR) Data User's Guide\" (TRF B30601), both available from NSSDC.

Data from CATS is used to derive properties of cloud/aerosol layers including: layer height, layer thickness, backscatter, optical depth, extinction, and depolarization-based discrimination of particle type. The instrument is located on the Japanese Experiment Module – Exposed Facility (JEM-EF) on the International Space Station (ISS). The ISS orbit is a 51-degree inclination orbit at an altitude of about 405 km. This orbit provides more comprehensive coverage of the tropics and mid-latitudes than sun-synchronous orbiting sensors, with nearly a three-day repeat cycle. CATS is intended to operate on-orbit for at least six months, and up to three years. The CATS payload is designed to provide a combination of long-term operational science, in-space technology demonstration, and technology risk reduction for future Earth Science missions. \n\nScience Goals:\nThe measurements of atmospheric clouds and aerosols provided by the CATS payload will be used for three main science objectives:\n\n1. Provide real-time observations of aerosol vertical distribution as inputs to global models. The vertical profile information obtained by CATS, particularly at multiple wavelengths and with depolarization information obtained in Modes 1 and 3, provides height location of cloud and aerosol layers, as well as information on particle size and shape.\n\n2. Extend the space-based lidar record for continuity in the lidar climate observations. The CATS instrument will provide measurements of cloud and aerosol profiles similar to CALIPSO, filling in the data gap, so this information can continually be used to improve climate models and our understanding of the Earth system and climate feedback processes.\n\n3.

        skos:definition  "The objectives of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) include surface and cloud imaging with high spatial resolution and with 14 multispectral channels from visible to thermal infrared and determination of surface kinetic temperatures.  The instrument consists of (1) three visible and near-infrared channels (VNIR) between 0.5 and 0.9 micrometers at 15 meter resolution, (2) six shortwave infrared channels (SWIR) between 1.6 and 2.5 micrometers at 30 meter resolution, and (3) five thermal infrared channels (TIR) between 8 and 12 micrometers at 90 meter resolution. The instrument will have 4 % absolute radiometric accuracy in the VNIR and SWIR, and 2 K absolute thermal accuracy (240 to 370 K) over a 60 km swath whose center is pointable cross-track +/- 106 km. One of the VNIR channels will provide along cross-track stereo views with a base-to-height ratio of 0.6, which will be used for stereoscopic observations of local topography, cloud heights, volcanic plumes, and generating local digital elevation models (DEMs). Various combinations of VNIR, SWIR, and TIR will lead to (1) soil and rock studies, (2) volcano monitoring, (3) surface temperature, emissivity, and reflectivity, (4) land use patterns and vegetation monitoring, (5) evapotranspiration, land and ocean temperatures, and (6) glacier monitoring. The ASTER pointing capabilities will be such that any point on the globe would be accessible at least once every 16 days. The ASTER facility is provided by the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) and was flown on the NASA Earth Observing System (EOS) Terra satellite on December 18, 1999.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: ASTER\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Imaging Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Short_Name: ASTER\n      Long_Name: Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer\n   End_Group\n   Group: Instrument_Associated_Sensors\n      Short_Name: TIRS\n      Short_Name: SWIR\n      Short_Name: VNIR\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: TERRA\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Number_Channels: 3\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.5 μm - 0.9 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Near Infrared\n      Number_Channels: 6\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 1.6 μm - 2.5 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Infrared > Thermal\n      Number_Channels: 5\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 8 μm - 12 μm\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://asterweb.jpl.nasa.gov/\n   Online_Resource: http://terra.nasa.gov/about/terra-instruments/aster\n   Sample_Image: https://asterweb.jpl.nasa.gov/content/01_mission/03_instrument/03_SWIR/swir-c.gif\n   Creation_Date: 2007-05-10\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n      Instrument_Owner: Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry\n      Instrument_Owner: Japan's Earth Remote Sensing Data Analysis Center\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

Each instrument was\na retarding-potential Langmuir-probe device that produced a\ncurrent-voltage (I-V) curve for a known voltage pattern placed\non the collector.  Electrometers were used to measure the\ncurrent. There were two systems of operation (one with two modes\nand another with three modes) using collector voltage patterns\nbetween plus and minus 5 volts.  Most modes involved an\nautomatic or fixed adjustment of collector voltage limits\n(and/or electrometer output) such that the region of interest on\nthe I-V profile provided high resolution.  Each system was\ndesigned for use with only one of the probes, but they could be\ninter-switched to provide backup redundancy.  The best\nmeasurements in the most favorable modes provided 1-s time\nresolution; electron temperature between 300 and 1.E4 deg K (10%\naccuracy); ion density between 1.E4 and 1.E7 ions/cc (10-20%\naccuracy); electron density between 50 and 1.E6 electrons/cc;\nand ion mass at ion densities above 1.E4.

Versions of the DORIS instrument are currently flying on the SPOT-2 and Topex-Poseidon missions.\n\nDORIS operates by measuring the Doppler frequency shift of a radio signal transmitted from ground stations and received on-board the satellite. The reference frequency for the measurement is generated by identical ultra-stable oscillators on the ground and on-board the spacecraft.\n\nCurrently there are about 50 ground beacons placed around the globe which cover about 75% of the ENVISAT orbit. On board measurements are performed every 7 - 10 seconds. Precise Doppler shift measurements are taken using an S-band frequency of 2.03625 GHz, while a second VHS band signal at 401.25 MHz is used for ionospheric correction of the propagation delay.\n\nOn the ground, DORIS data is used to create precise orbit reconstruction models which are then used for all satellite instruments requiring precise orbit position information. In addition, DORIS operates in a Navigator mode in which on-board positioning calculations are performed in real-time and relayed to the ground segment. \n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: DORIS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Positioning/Navigation\n      Instrument_Subtype: Radio\n      Short_Name: DORIS\n      Long_Name: Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: CRYOSAT-2\n      Short_Name: ENVISAT\n      Short_Name: JASON-1\n      Short_Name: OSTM/JASON-2\n      Short_Name: SPOT-2\n      Short_Name: SPOT-3\n      Short_Name: SPOT-4\n      Short_Name: TOPEX/POSEIDON\n      Short_Name: SPOT-5\n      Short_Name: CRYOSAT\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Radio\n      Number_Channels: 2 Channels\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 401.25 MHz and 2036.25MHz\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://envisat.esa.int/instruments/doris/\n   Online_Resource: http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com/en/doris/index.html\n   Sample_Image: http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com/typo3temp/pics/98d5269f70.jpg\n   Creation_Date: 2007-04-16\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Data_Rate: 330 bps\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 2002-01-15\n      Instrument_Owner: France/CNES\n   End_Group\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 1992-09-23\n      Instrument_Stop_Date: 2005-10-09\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "\nThe Radar Altimeter (RA) is one of the instruments carried on-board of\nthe European Remote Sensing Satellites (ERS-1 and ERS-2) launched by\nthe European Space Agency on 17 July 1991 and 20 April 1995.\n\nERS-1 and ERS-2, operating in a sun-synchronous orbit, were conceived\nas an orbiting platform that would be capable of measuring the Earth's\natmospheric and surface properties with a high degree of accuracy on a\nglobal scale.\n\nThe RA is a nadir-pointing active microwave sensor designed to make\nprecise measurements of the echoes from ocean and ice surfaces. It\nprovides information on:\n\n- significant wave height\n- surface\nwind speed\n- sea surface elevation, which relates to ocean currents, the\nsurface\ngeoid and tides\n- various parameters over sea ice and\nice sheets\n\n\nThe RA is relatively simple in concept, but depends on electronic\nprecision and a sophisticated data processor to achieve its\nperformance. The RA operates by timing the two-way delay for a short\nduration radio frequency (RF) pulse, transmitted vertically\ndownwards. The required level of accuracy in range measurements\n(better than 10 cm) calls for a pulse length of a few nsec, therefore,\nin order to reduce the RF power requirements a pulse compression\n(chirp) technique is used.\n\nInstrument characteristics:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nFrequency: 13.8 GHz\nBandwidth: 330 MHz (ocean mode); 82.5 MHz (ice mode)\nBeamwidth: 1.3 degrees at 3 dB\nFootprint: up to 20 km (depending on sea state)\nMass: 96 kg\nAntenna diameter: 1.2 m\nPulse length: 20 ms chirp\nRF transmit power: 50 W\nPulse repetition frequency: 1020 Hz\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe RA operates in three modes:\n\n\n- acquisition mode, during which the radar finds the\napproximate distance to the surface and then switches to\none of the tracking modes\n- ocean tracking mode\n- ice tracking mode where an increased dynamic range is\nused, obtained by reducing the chirp bandwidth by a factor\nof four to 82.5 MHz, resulting in a coarser\nresolution\n\n\nEcho characteristics are analysed with respect to:\n\n\n- time delay of return pulse, providing altitude\nmeasurements\n- slope of the echo leading edge, relating to wave height\nparameters\n- power level of return signal, affected by small scale\nsurface roughness giving an indication of surface wind\nfield parameters\n\n\nOver the ocean the waveform profile is sufficiently well understood to\npermit real-time estimates of ocean parameters to be carried out\non-board the satellite. For other surfaces the waveform shape does not\nalways conform to a simple model and further data analysis is\nnecessary. The return echo from sea ice appears more specular than\nfrom the ocean and has a peaked trace.\n\nThe information provided by the RA, in accordance with the objective\nof the ERS programme, is of significant importance to the commercial\nand scientific user communities, with marked benefits for ocean\nrelated activities, including ship routing and the design of offshore\nfacilities. Infact the RA was designed to permit the following:\n\n\n- Ice mapping and monitoring\n- Weather and sea state forecast\n- Sea surface topography and ocean currents\n- Experimental altimetry over land\n\n\nRelated URL: \"http://earth.esa.int/ra\"\n\nReference online documentation:\n\"http://earth.esa.int/services/esa_doc/doc_ra_.html\"\n\nFor any query, please refer to:\n\nESA/ESRIN Earth Observation Help Desk\n\n\"http://earth.esa.int\"\n\nE-mail: eohelp@esa.int\n\nPhone: +39 06 94180777\n\nFax: +39 06 94180292\n\nAddress:\n\nESA/ESRIN\n\nVia G.Galilei\n\n00044 Frascati\n\nItaly\n"@en ;

These sensors\nconsist of: a pair of orthogonal two-sphere electric antennas in the spin plane\nof the spacecraft with sphere-to-sphere separations of 100 meters and 130\nmeters respectively, shared with the Electric Field Instrument (EFI); a short\ntwo-sphere electric antenna aligned along the spacecraft spin axis with a\nsphere-to-sphere separation of 14 meters, also shared with EFI; a triaxial\nmagnetic search coil mounted on the end of a rigid stacer boom, shared with\nEFI; and a magnetic loop antenna mounted on the same boom and oriented parallel\nto the 100-meter electric antenna in the spin plane.\n\nThe spheres on the electric antennas are 9 cm in diameter and each contains a\nhigh-impedance preamplifier that provides signals to the boom deployment\nmechanisms. Amplifiers in the deployment mechanisms buffer signals to EFI and\nPWI independently. Each of the three magnetic search coils consists of two\nbobbins mounted on high permeability micro-metal cores 40cm long. Each bobbin\nis wound with 10,000 turns of #40 wire. The coil outputs are amplified by a\npreamplifier in the search coil housing to provide a low-impedance signal to\nthe main electronics box. The search coil sensitivity constant is 70 micro\nV/nT-Hz and the resonance frequency is approximately 10 kHz. The loop antenna\nis similar to the magnetic loop antenna on Dynamics Explorer A and is designed\nto detect magnetic fields over a frequency range from 25 Hz to 800 kHz. The\nloop sensitivity constant is 385 micro V/nT-Hz and the resonance frequency is\n45 kHz. \n\nFor more information, see:\nhttp://www-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/plasma-wave/istp/\nand\nhttp://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/polar/polar_inst.shtml\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: PWI-P\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Solar/Space Observing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Magnetic Field/Electric Field Instruments\n      Short_Name: PWI-P\n      Long_Name: Plasma Waves Investigation (Polar)\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: POLAR\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/plasma-wave/istp/polar/home.html\n   Online_Resource: http://www-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/plasma-wave/istp/polar/instrument.html\n   Sample_Image: http://www-pw.physics.uiowa.edu/plasma-wave/istp/polar/images/PolarComponents.jpg\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 1996-02-24\n      Instrument_Owner: University of Iowa\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

Each satellite transmits carrier phase signals on two frequencies allowing for ionospheric corrections. The 10 Hz samples of the phase change at the two frequencies for each satellite are down-linked to ground. The appropriately decimated linear combination of the sum of these phase measurements at each frequency gives the ionosphere-corrected measurement of the range change between the satellites. To reduce measurement errors, the KBR temperature has to be controlled to 0.2 K. Additionally multipath effects are reduced by stringent spacecraft pointing requirements (< 1 mrad) and representative antenna and spacecraft front panels.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: GRACE KBR\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Active Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Altimeters\n      Instrument_Subtype: Radar Altimeters\n      Short_Name: GRACE KBR\n      Long_Name: K-Band Ranging system\n   End_Group\n   Group: Instrument_Associated_Sensors\n      Short_Name: USO\n      Short_Name: IPU\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: GRACE\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://grace.jpl.nasa.gov/\n   Online_Resource: http://www.csr.utexas.edu/grace/spacecraft/sis.html#sis2\n   Online_Resource: http://www.gfz-potsdam.de/portal/\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

The CHAMP Blackjack started collecting atmospheric profiles on April 6, 2001 and since then has been collecting up to 250 daily occultations during much of 2001. This receiver has enhanced capabilities over the older generation GPS/MET instrument which include \"enhanced codeless\" tracking (i.e., the ability to track the encrypted GPS signals), higher signal-to-noise ratio, and lower tracking in the atmosphere. The Blackjack GPS receiver is capturing high vertical resolution profiles over land and oceans and is providing data complementary to other sounding techniques.

This instrument flown on GOES 4-8 is a visible and infrared radiometer that provides image (VISSR mode) and sounding (VAS mode) data.  The VAS retained the VISSR dual-band imaging function while expanding to 6 infrared channels.  The additional spectral bands provided are sensitive to the effects of atmospheric constituents which allows for determination of surface and cloud-top temperatures as in VISSR along with three-dimensional structure of the atmospheric temperature and water-vapor distribution.  The 12 Infrared spectral bands span central wavelengths from 3.9 to 15.0um.  The ground resolution is 1km in the visible range and 7km (imaging) and 14km (sounding) in the infrared ranges.

This\ndirect sampling of solar matter is a way to study events on the solar surface\nand the incorporation of solar material into the solar wind. EPACT will also\nprovide information on shocks in the interplanetary medium, which accelerate\nparticles from solar-wind energies to several hundred keV.  \nThe EPACT instrument consists of three integrated telescope/electronics boxes\nmounted on the body of the spacecraft. The extensive dynamic range of particles\nto be measured is divided between three Low Energy Matrix Telescopes (LEMT),\ntwo Alpha-Proton-Electron Telescopes (APE), an Isotope Telescope (IT), and a\nSupra Thermal Energetic Particle Telescope (STEP). The APE and IT instruments\nare contained in a single package known as the Electron Isotope Telescope\n(ELITE). These solid state detector telescopes all use the dE/dx by E method of\nparticle identification, except STEP, which obtains particle mass by measuring\ntime-of flight and energy. An onboard recorder allows continuous observations\nto be made.\nFor more information, see:\nhttp://lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/gamcosray/lecr/EPACT/epact.html\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: EPACT\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Solar/Space Observing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Particle Detectors\n      Short_Name: EPACT\n      Long_Name: Energetic Particles: Acceleration, Composition and Transport (WIND)\n   End_Group\n   Group: Instrument_Associated_Sensors\n      Short_Name: LEMT\n      Short_Name: APE\n      Short_Name: STEP/EPACT\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: WIND\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Gamma Ray\n      Number_Channels: 3\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.1 - 500 MeV\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/gamcosray/lecr/EPACT/epact.html\n   Sample_Image: http://lheawww.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/gamcosray/lecr/EPACT/EPACT_files/lemt_pic.jpeg\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 1994-11-01\n      Instrument_Owner: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "The Optical Plankton Counter (OPC) is an operational instrument that detects, sizes, and counts individual particles based on measuring the attenuance, or diminution in intensity, of a collimated light beam intercepted by transiting particles.

Thus, nearly the full size spectrum of mesozooplankton can be registered, as well as euphausiids, fish eggs, other small organisms, marine snow, and seston, or small particulate matter in suspension. The nature of the particles being sensed and quantified must be determined by physical capture, a process that is sometimes referred to as calibration. Particle concentrations as high as 10,000 particles per cubic meter can be resolved for counting purposes. The OPC is often towed, at speeds up to 8 knots, but it can also be attached to moorings and other platforms, and may be used in the laboratory. Its ordinary depth rating is 1000 m, but that of a special model is 4000 m.\n\nInformation obtained from http://www.usm.maine.edu/gulfofmaine-census/\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: OPC\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: In Situ/Laboratory Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Photon/Optical Detectors\n      Short_Name: OPC\n      Long_Name: Optical Plankton Counter\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://research.usm.maine.edu/gulfofmaine-census/research/research-technology/optical-instruments-and-methods-for-remote-sensing/optical-plankton-counter-opc/\n   Sample_Image: http://research.usm.maine.edu/gulfofmaine-census/wp-content/images/Technology/OPCImage01b.jpg\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-18\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "The Energetic PArticles Composition instrument EPAC pn Ulysses was designed to\nprovide information on the flux, anisotropy and chemical composition of\nenergetic particles in interplanetary space. EPAC consists of four identical\ntelescopes inclined under angles of 22.5 deg, 67.5 deg, 112.5 deg and 157.5 deg\nwith respect to the spacecraft spin axis. This design, together with spin\nsectorisation, allows us to sample 80% of the sphere in 32 bins and therefore\nget a fully three-dimensional resolution of angular distributions. In each of\nthe telescopes we used the so-called \"E-dE/dx\" technique, which requires a\nparticle to traverse a very thin detector and then stop it in a second, much\nthicker detector. Particles of higher energies can traverse the two detector\nstack, but are eliminated by a third \"veto\" detector. Each telescope has a\ngeometric factor of about 0.08 cm\"sr and has a field-of-view with a full angle\nof 35 deg.\n\nAs a front detector we used an very thin semiconductor detector with a\nthickness of 5 um and 25 mm\" sensitive area (detector A). Such detectors became\navailable in reliable technique by the time when we started to build the\ninstrument. The energy detector B was 100 ým thick. A third detector (C) of\nmuch larger area provided veto signals from penetrating particles. The detector\nstack is surrounded by a massive platinum shield. Further background rejection\nis realised by using multiparameter analysis. The front detectors are protected\nagainst sunlight by 80 ug/cm\" Al-layers. By using hybrid electronic technology\nwe were able to make this fairly complicated instrument with very low weight\n(2685 g) and power demand (3.43 W).\n\nThe telescopes based on this design allowed clear separation of Hydrogen,\nHelium and the heavier nuclei up to iron. 14 different categories of data are\ntransmitted to the ground, using different time and angular resolutions for the\nvarious categories. In flight a functional performance test using a pulse\ngenerator, which on command produced sequences of coincident and non-coincident\npulses is initiated from time to time. The sensor was designed to operate at\ntemperatures between +10C near Earth and -35C at Jupiter. \nA full description can be found in: E. Keppler et al., Astron. Astrophys.\nSuppl.

        skos:definition  "The primary function of the ultraviolet spectrometer (UVS) is to measure the density of nitric oxide between the altitudes of 100 and 200 km in the terrestrial upper atmosphere by observing the (1,0) and (0,1) gamma bands. The UVS design is similar to instruments flown on the Solar Mesospheric Explorer (SME), Pioneer Venus, and several rocket flights. It consists of an Ebert-Fastie spectrometer, an off-axis telescope, and two Hamamatsu phototube detectors. The spectrometer has a focal length of 125 mm and uses a 3600 l/mm mechanically ruled plane grating which produces a dispersion of 1.8 nm/mm at the detectors. The phototubes each have fused silica windows and a cesium telluride photocathode. The telescope is an off-axis parabola with a 250 mm focal length and is used to image the spectrometer slit on the limb. The combination of the spectrometer and the detectors produces a spacing of 22 nm between the two channels and the exit slits are sized to give each detector a 3.7 nm bandpass. The grating in the spectrometer will be set to place the (1,0) gamma band ( 215 nm) on one detector and the (0,1) gamma band (237 nm) on the other detector. Both channels have a sensitivity of 450 counts/second/kiloRayleigh.\n\nThe UVS is mounted with its optical axis perpendicular to the spin axis of the S/C. Its telescope images the entrance slit of the spectrometer on the limb with the long axis of the slit parallel to the horizon. The image of the slit on the limb is 3.5 km high, which determines the fundamental altitude resolution of the instrument. The integration time of the is set to 27 milliseconds. To minimize requirements on the S/C, data are stored for the downward limb scan only. Allowing for some overscan, this produces 65 samples per spin from each channel. The storage operation is initiated by a signal derived from the horizon crossing indicator in the ADCS. The data are stored in a buffer which is emptied, time-tagged, and stored once per spin by the S/C microprocessor.\n\nSummary provided by http://lasp.colorado.edu/snoe/spacecraft/instruments.html\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: UVS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Solar/Space Observing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Ultraviolet Instruments\n      Short_Name: UVS\n      Long_Name: ULTRAVIOLET SPECTROMETER (SNOE)\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: SNOE\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://lasp.colorado.edu/snoe/spacecraft/instruments.html\n   Sample_Image: http://lasp.colorado.edu/snoe/images/UVS_New.gif\n   Creation_Date: 2009-10-07\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

Scientists believe that low frequency magnetic fluctuations and waves play an important role in triggering substorms. Frequencies of the waves range from several octaves below the lowest key on the piano (0.1 Hz) up to the top key on the piano (4 kHz). The SCM will measure this range to identify the instability that triggers substorms. Data from the SCM will be especially important in studying the waves in the “current disruption region” about 10 Earth Radii away from Earth in the magnetotail plasma sheet, as well as at larger distances where neutral lines are expected to form. Together with the other instruments of the THEMIS suite, the SCM will reveal the link between waves and the location(s) where substorms begin, thereby identifying the basic substorm mechanism.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: SCM\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Solar/Space Observing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Magnetic Field/Electric Field Instruments\n      Short_Name: SCM\n      Long_Name: SEARCH COIL MAGNETOMETERS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: THEMIS\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/themis/spacecraft/SCM.html\n   Online_Resource: http://themis.ssl.berkeley.edu/instrument_scm.shtml\n   Sample_Image: http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/168039main_SCM_ETU_1_med.jpg\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-18\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: CETP (France)\n      Instrument_Owner: NASA (USA)\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

Spatial samples are acquired every 275 meters. Over a period of 7 minutes, a 360 km wide swath of Earth comes into view at all 9 angles. Special attention has been paid to providing highly accurate absolute and relative calibration, using on-board hardware consisting of deployable solar diffuser plates and several types of photodiodes. To complement the on-board calibration effort, a validation program of in situ measurements are being conducted, involving field instruments, one of which is the &PARABOLA III&, which automatically scans the sky and ground at many angles, and a multi-angle aircraft camera (AirMISR). Global coverage with MISR is acquired about once every 9 days at the equator; the nominal lifetime of the mission is 6 years.\n\nMISR was built for NASA by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and is one of five instruments launched into polar orbit aboard NASA's Terra spacecraft in August 1999. The spacecraft flys in a sun-synchronous orbit, designed so that it crosses the equator every 98 minutes, always at 10:30 a.m. local time, as Earth rotates below. \n\n[Source: MISR Project Home Page http://www-misr.jpl.nasa.gov/]\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: MISR\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Imaging Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Short_Name: MISR\n      Long_Name: Multi-Angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: TERRA\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Near Infrared\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: Near Infrared\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: Blue, Green, Red\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www-misr.jpl.nasa.gov/\n   Online_Resource: https://eosweb.larc.nasa.gov/project/misr/misr_table\n   Online_Resource: http://terra.nasa.gov/about/terra-instruments/misr\n   Online_Resource: http://www-misr.jpl.nasa.gov/Mission/misrInstrument/\n   Sample_Image: http://www-misr.jpl.nasa.gov/images/mws/misrpic.jpg\n   Creation_Date: 2007-07-19\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Data_Rate: 3.3 Megabits/second average, 9.0 Megabits/second peak\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 2000-02-01\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

The   instrument  consisted  of  three\nsingle-axis  accelerometers,  mounted mutually at right angles,\ntwo in the spacecraft X-Y plane and the other along the Z-axis.\nThe  instrument  determined  the  applied acceleration from the\nelectrostatic  force  required  to  recenter  a proof mass. The\noutput  of  the device was a digital pulse rate proportional to\nthe  applied  acceleration.  The sample time of each instrument\nwas  0.25  s.  The  measurements  allowed  determination of the\ndensity  of the neutral atmosphere, monitored the thrust of the\nOrbit-Adjust Propulsion System (OAPS), determined the satellite\nminimum  altitude,  measured spacecraft roll, and provided some\nattitude-sensing information. Spacecraft nutations of less than\n0.01  deg  were monitored. The instrument had three sensitivity\nranges: 8.E-3 earth's gravity (G) in OAPS monitor mode; 4.E-4 G\nbetween  120  km  (plus  or minus 2%) and 280 km (plus or minus\n10%);  and 2.E-5 G between 180 km (plus or minus 2%) and 400 km\n(plus  or  minus 10%). Numbers in parentheses represent errors.\nThere  may  be a systematic error of up to plus or minus 5% due\nto   drag  coefficient  uncertainty.  The  highest  measurement\naltitude  was determined assuming the instrument could sense to\n0.2% of full scale.\n\n[Summary provided by NASA]\n\n\n\n"@en ;

A double-focusing,\nMattauch-Herzog magnetic deflection mass spectrometer with an\nimpact ion source was flown.  Two ion collectors were included\nto measure ions differing in mass by a factor of 8; i.e., the\ntwo mass ranges covered were 1 to 6 and 6 to 48 u. In the ion\nsource the neutral species were ionized by means of electron\nimpact. The electron energies were selectable; 75 eV for the\nhigh-eV mode and 25 eV for the low-eV mode. At altitudes greater\nthan 380 km, ion currents were measured with an electron\nmultiplier.  Counts were accumulated for 1/20 s before\nautomatically switching to a different mass number.  While\ncomplete mass spectra could be swept, in the common mode of\noperation peak stepping was employed; readings on principal\npeaks in the mass spectrum were repeated approximately every 0.5\ns and on other species less frequently. Data below 380 km were\nmeasured using an electrometer.  In addition to the peak\nstepping mode, there were several other operating modes which\nwere selected by ground command.  In the fly-through mode,\nambient particles striking the ion source retained energies less\nthan 0.1 eV, which was not high enough to overcome the negative\nspace charge potential holding the ions in the beam.  Those\nambient particles that did not strike the ion source retained\ntheir incoming energy of several eV after ionization and escaped\ninto the acceleration region of the analyzer.\n\n[Summary provided by NASA]\n\n\n"@en ;

The experiment consisted of an optical system, detector and associated electronics, and a scanning mirror. The scanning mirror was stepped across the satellite groundtrack, allowing the sounder to view 25 separate columns of the atmosphere every 32 s over a cross track ground swath of 2204 km. While the scanning mirror was stopped at each of the 25 positions, the channel filters were sequenced through the field of view. The cross track surface resolution was approximately 60 km at nadir.

This approach is\ndifferent from other canopy imaging methods (such as fish-eye\nphotography) because it emphasizes measuring the fraction of an\nimage occupied by various scene components (branches, shaded\nleaves, sunlit leaves) under different sky conditions rather\nthan simply the canopy gap fraction under uniform sky\nconditions.\n\n[Summary provided by the University of Wisconsin-Madison]\n\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "The Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit-B (AMSU-B) is a 5 channel microwave radiometer. The purpose of the instrument is to receive and measure radiation from a number of different layers of the atmosphere in order to obtain global data on humidity profiles. It works in conjunction with the AMSU-A instruments to provide a 20 channel microwave radiometer.\n\nAMSU-B is a cross-track, line scanned instrument designed to measure scene radiances in 5 channels. At each channel frequency, the antenna beam width is a constant 1.1 degrees (at the half power point). Ninety contiguous scene resolution cells are sampled in a continuous fashion, each scan covering 50 degrees on each side of the sub satellite path. These scan patterns and geometric resolution translate to a 16.3 km diameter cell at nadir at a nominal altitude of 850 km.\n\nThe AMSU-B instrument consists of a scanning parabolic reflector antenna which is rotated once every 8/3 seconds and focuses incoming radiation into a quasi-optic system which then separates the frequencies of interest into three separate feed horns of the receiver assembly. The receiver subsystem provides further demultiplexing of the 183 GHz signal in order to selectively acquire three defined double sided bands around the 183 GHz signal. \n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: AMSU-B\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Profilers/Sounders\n      Short_Name: AMSU-B\n      Long_Name: ADVANCED MICROWAVE SOUNDING UNIT B (AMSU-B)\n   End_Group\n   Group: Instrument_Associated_Sensors\n      Short_Name: AMSU-B\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: NOAA-17\n      Short_Name: NOAA-16\n      Short_Name: NOAA-15\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Microwave\n      Number_Channels: 5\n      Spectral_Frequency_Resolution: 1.1 degree\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www2.ncdc.noaa.gov/docs/klm/html/c3/sec3-4.htm\n   Creation_Date: 2008-03-18\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

The maximum range of the NEXRAD\nradar is 250 nautical miles. The NEXRAD network provides\nsignificant improvements in severe weather and flash flood\nwarnings, air traffic safety, flow control for air traffic,\nresource protection at military bases, and management of water,\nagriculture, forest, and snow removal.\n\nThe NEXRAD is capable of operating in three different modes,\nPrecipitation mode, Clean air Mode, and Severe weather mode. The\nradar is placed in precipitation mode when a significant amount\nof precipitation is detected. It completes nine full scans at\ndifferent elevation angles between 0.5 and 19.5 degrees and is\nupdated every six minutes. The NEXRAD offers much more\nresolution in precip levels. Old radars only had six precip\nlevels, the NEXRAD has fifteen levels, which enables it to give\nmore accurate descriptions on the intensity of precipitation.\n\nWhen the NEXRAD is placed in clean air mode the radar becomes\nmore sensitive and is updated every ten minutes after completing\nfive full scans at different elevation angles between 0.5 and\n4.5 degrees. It is useful to measure those winds in \"clear air\"\nfrom very weak returns on dust, insect, smoke, etc. It is also\ncapable of depicting snow very well, a feature that old radars\nhad trouble with. The Severe weather mode is activated when a\nsevere weather pattern is detected. The radar then completes\nfourteen scans between 0.5 and 19.5 degrees in five minutes. The\nNEXRAD calculates both the speed and direction of motion of\nsevere storms. By providing information on wind patterns within\ndeveloping storms, the NEXRAD identifies conditions leading to\ntornadoes and can subsequently give accurate data on the\ndirection and speed of formed tornadoes.\n\nAdditional information available at\n\"http://www.roc.noaa.gov/\"\n\n[Summary provided by NOAA Radar Operations Center]\n\n\n"@en ;

The purpose of this experiment was to provide global, day/night observations of cloudcover and cloud temperature measurements to support Department of Defense requirements for operational weather analysis and forecasting. The radiometer operated in two spectral intervals -- (1) visible and near infrared (0.4 to 1.1 micrometers) and (2) infrared (8 to 13 micrometers). The three-channel radiometer was essentially two scanning radiometers driven by a common motor. One radiometer provided high resolution (HR) visual and infrared (IR) data with nadir resolutions of 3.7 and 4.4 km, respectively. The other radiometer produced very high resolution (VHR) visual and infrared (WHR) data with nadir resolutions of .63 km and .67 km, respectively. On board recorders had a storage capacity of 210 min of both HR and IR data and a total of 20 min of VHR and WHR data. For direct readout to tactical sites, the experiment was programmed so that VHR and IR data were obtained during the daytime and HR and WHR data were obtained at night. The infrared channels (WHR and IR) covered a temperature range of 210 to 310 deg k with an accuracy of 1 deg c. Electronic circuitry in the sensor converted the sensed infrared energy directly into equivalent black body temperature (as opposed to radiance) prior to transmission to ground sites. The HR channel included a zero resolution sensor which measured solar input and was used to control channel gain, thereby producing an output signal that represents scene albedo. This feature also made it possible to obtain useful visual data at night. The sensor incorporated sunshades and glare suppression devices in conjunction with a long-scan automatic gain control which allowed the HR channel to provide usable data through the day/night terminator. Identical experiments were flown on all DMSP Block 5 spacecraft to date.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: SR\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Imaging Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Short_Name: SR\n      Long_Name: Scanning Radiometer\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: DMSP 5B/F3\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.4 μm - 1.1 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Near Infrared\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.4 μm - 1.1 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Infrared > Thermal\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 8 μm to 13 μm\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1972-089A-01\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

By means of a servo driven, two-axis gimbaled mirror scanning system in conjunction with a Cassegrain telescope, the Imager's multispectral channels can simultaneously sweep an 8-kilometer (5 statute mile) north-to-south swath along an east-to-west/west-to-east path, at a rate of 20 degrees (optical) east-west per second. This translates into being able to scan a 3000 by 3000 km (1864 by 1864 miles) \"box\" centered over the United States in just 41 seconds. The actual scanning sequence takes places by sweeping in an East-West direction, stepping in the North-South direction, than sweeping back in a West-East direction, stepping North-South, sweeping East-West, and so on.\n\nThe Imager consists of electronics, power supply, and sensor modules. The sensor module containing the telescope, scan assembly, and detectors, is mounted on a baseplate outside the main structure of the spacecraft, together with shields and louvers for thermal control. The electronics module provides redundant circuitry and performs command, control, and signal processing functions; it also serves as a structure for mounting and interconnecting the electronic boards for proper heat dissipation. The power supply module contains the converters, fuses, and power control for interfacing with the spacecraft electrical power subsystem.

        skos:definition  "[Source: National Space Science Data Center, http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1964-052A-03 ]\n\nThe Nimbus 1 High-Resolution Infrared Radiometer (HRIR) was designed (1) to map the earth's nighttime cloudcover and thus to complement the daytime television (AVCS) coverage and (2) to measure the radiative temperatures of cloud tops and surface terrain. Mounted on the earth-oriented sensory ring, the radiometer measured thermal radiation in the 3.5- to 4.1-micrometer \"window\" region. The HRIR subsystem consisted of (1) an optical system, (2) an infrared detector (lead selenide photoconductive material), (3) electronics, (4) a magnetic tape recorder, and (5) a filter to minimize attenuation effects of water vapor and carbon dioxide. In contrast to the AVCS camera, no image was formed within the radiometer. The HRIR sensor merely transformed the received radiation into an electrical voltage, which was recorded on the tape recorder for subsequent playback when the satellite came within range of an acquisition station. The radiometer had an instantaneous field of view of about 1.5 deg, which at a nominal spacecraft altitude corresponded to a ground resolution of approximately 8 km at nadir. The radiometer was capable of measuring radiance temperatures from 210 to 330 K. Since the radiometer operated in the 3.5- to 4.1-micrometer region, the daytime pictures include reflected solar radiation in addition to the emitted surface IR radiation. However, the reflected solar radiation did not saturate the instrument, and a usable output was still obtained. In spite of a short operational lifetime (3.5 weeks), the HRIR system successfully demonstrated the feasibility of complete surveillance of surface and cloud features on a global scale during nighttime. With its improved spatial resolution, the radiometer yielded more detailed visual data on the structure of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and on the formation of tropical storms and frontal systems than had previously been possible. For a more detailed description and an index of the data, see \"Nimbus I High Resolution Radiation Data Catalog and Users' Manual\" (TRF B04500), available from NSSDC.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: HRIR NIMBUS-1\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Radiometers\n      Short_Name: HRIR NIMBUS-1\n      Long_Name: High-Resolution Infrared Radiometer on NIMBUS-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: NIMBUS-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Infrared > Thermal\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 3.5 μm - 4.1 μm\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1964-052A-03\n   Online_Resource: http://atmospheres.gsfc.nasa.gov/nimbus/\n   Online_Resource: http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/nimbus\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

A few cameras still serve live television production, but most live connections are for security, military/tactical, and industrial operations where surreptitious or remote viewing is required. The second is to have the images recorded to a storage device for archiving or further processing; for many years, videotape was the primary format used for this purpose, but optical disc media, hard disk, and flash memory are all increasingly used.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: VIDEO CAMERA\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Photon/Optical Detectors\n      Instrument_Subtype: Cameras\n      Short_Name: VIDEO CAMERA\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_camera\n   Sample_Image: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Sonyhdrfx1.jpg\n   Creation_Date: 2010-08-31\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "The objective of the Active Cavity Radiometer (ACR) Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM) is to measure the total solar irradiance with state-of-the-art accuracy and precision.  The ACRIM instrument was first flown on the Solar Maximum Mission (SMM/ACRIM I) satellite and was flown on all three Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science (ATLAS) missions and the Spacelab 1 misson from the Space Shuttle.  In addition, ACRIM was flown as a flight-of-opportunity instrument on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS/ACRIM II) and is scheduled to fly as a flight-of-opportunity mission during NASA's Earth Observation System (EOS) program (ACRIMSAT/ACRIM III) The principal role of the ACRIM is to support extended solar irradiance experiments on free-flying satellites and establishment of the radiation scale at the solar total flux level through direct intercomparison with other experiments. The total solar irradiance (TSI) from far ultraviolet through far infrared is measured by three Type V active-cavity radiometer sensors. These detectors are electrically self-calibrated, cavity pyrheliometers each capable of defining the absolute radiation scale with an uncertainty of +/- 0.1% SI units. The single sample irradiance precision is +/-0.012 %. The three sensors are independently shuttered and their measurement cycles are different so that the three sensors can be used in various combinations to provide periodic cross references on the system's performance.

The viewing geometry involves a unique scanning\ntechnique where the surface is viewed at two angles, one close to the\nnadir (0 degree, nadir swath) and the other at 47 degrees (forward\nswath), within the space of two minutes (the time it takes the\nsub-satellite point to reach the along track point which is separated\nby approximately 800 km). These two swaths are produced by a scanning\nmirror with a rotation axis inclined 23.45 degrees from the vertical,\nresulting in a near-elliptical path on the Earth's surface.\n\nOn-board calibration is carried out by incorporating two 'black\nbodies' into the instrument scan pattern. The IR sensors are kept to\n80 K by an active cooling system to minimize the thermal noise\ncomponent in the sensor signals.\n\nATSR-IRR characteristics:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nSpectral channels: 1.6, 3.7, 11 and 12 microns\nSpatial resolution: 1 km x 1 km (nadir); 1.5 km x 2 km\n(forward)\nSwath width: 500 km\nDetector: single element InSb and HgCdTe\nCooler: Stirling Cycle Cooler\nRadiometric precision: 0.1 K\nSST predicted accuracy: 0.5 K over a 50 kmx 50 km square\nwith 80% cloud cover\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe ATSR was designed to provide the following:\n\n\n- global  sea surface temperature, accurate to better than\n0.5K (absolute) with a spatial resolution of 50 Km in\nconditions of up to 80% cloud cover\n- images of surface temperature, accurate to 0.1K\n(relative) with 1 km resolution and 500 km swath width\n- total water vapour content of the atmosphere\n- observations of clouds, aerosols, haze, land-ice and\nsea-ice surface emissivity\n- tropospheric range correction of the Radar Altimeter\nmeasurements to better than 5 cm\n\n\nThe ATSR provides important information in scientific disciplines such\nas oceanography, climatology and meteorology. When combined with\nobservations of cloud top temperatures, cloud cover, haze, aerosol and\ntotal water vapour content of the atmosphere, significant improvements\nmay be expected in the accuracy of medium range weather\nforecasting. Also accurate sea surface temperatures can be of use to a\nnumber of commercial users, particularly those involved in fishing and\nthe management of fishing areas. In the field of research, potential\napplications of the ATSR include distinguishing thin new ice from open\nwater, identifying surface type, and the accumulation rate of land\nice.\n\nRelated URL: \"http://earth.esa.int/atsr/\"\n\nReference online documentation:\n\"http://earth.esa.int/services/esa_doc/doc_ats.html\"\n\nFor any query, please refer to:\n\nESA/ESRIN Earth Observation Help Desk\n\n\"http://earth.esa.int\"\n\nE-mail: eohelp@esa.int\n\nPhone: +39 06 94180777\n\nFax: +39 06 94180292\n\nAddress:\n\nESA/ESRIN\n\nVia G.Galilei\n\n00044 Frascati\n\nItaly\n"@en ;

The camera used a 108-deg wide-angle f/1.8 objective lens with a focal length of 5.7 mm. The camera was mounted facing earthward on the H-frame inside the sensory ring, with its optical axis parallel to the spacecraft spin axis. The actual picture taking required 8 s and the transmission 200 s. Earth-cloud images retained on the photo-sensitive surface of the 2.54-cm-diameter vidicon were read out at four lines per second to produce an 800-line picture. A 5-W TV transmitter (136.95 MHz) relayed the pictures to local APT stations within communication range. The faceplate of the vidicon had reticle marks that appeared on the picture format to aid in relating the picture to its geographical position on the earth's surface. At the nominal satellite altitude, a picture covered approximately a 1660- by 1660-km square with a horizontal resolution of around 3 km at nadir. The experiment supplied over 1600 high-quality cloudcover pictures to participating APT stations during the spacecraft's 3.5-week lifetime. It proved the capability of weather satellites to provide high-quality daytime local cloudcover data to operational meteorologists on an essentially real-time basis. Its success bolstered the decision to include such instrumentation in the TIROS Operational System (TOS). For more detailed information of the experiment, see \"APT Users' Guide\" (TRF B04499), available from NSSDC. APT data are primarily intended for operational use within the local APT acquisition station and are generally not available for distribution.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: APT NIMBUS-1\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Photon/Optical Detectors\n      Instrument_Subtype: Cameras\n      Short_Name: APT NIMBUS-1\n      Long_Name: Automatic Picture Transmission System on NIMBUS-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: NIMBUS-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1964-052A-02\n   Online_Resource: http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/nimbus\n   Online_Resource: http://atmospheres.gsfc.nasa.gov/nimbus/\n   Creation_Date: 2009-07-16\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "The auroral photometer (AP) is a two-channel broad-band instrument that is used to determine the energy deposited in the upper atmosphere by energetic auroral electrons. It is similar to airglow photometers developed by LASP and flown on OGO-5 and -6 in the late 1960's. The channels consist of two Hamamatsu phototube detectors, a UV filter for each channel, and a field of view limiter for each channel. Both channels have circular fields of view, 11 degree full-cone. The detectors are identical phototubes with magnesium fluoride (MgF2) windows and cesium iodide (CsI) photocathodes. Channel A has a calcium fluoride (CaF2) filter placed in front of the detector and channel B has a barium fluoride (BaF2) filter. The combination of the CsI photocathode and the CaF2 filter produces a bandpass from 125 to 180 nm for channel A, allowing a combined measurement of the LBH bands, the OI doublet at 135.6 nm, and the OI triplet at 130.4 nm. Channel B has a 135 to 180 nm bandpass, providing a measurement of the LBH bands and the OI doublet at 135.6 nm with the exclusion of the OI triplet at 130.4 nm. The sensitivity of channel A at 130.4 nm is 23 counts/second/Rayleigh and the sensitivity of channel B at 135.6 nm is 26 counts/second/Rayleigh. The AP and UVS photomultiplier electronics are identical, resulting in significant economies in fabrication and operation.\n\nAs with the UVS, the AP is mounted with its optical axis perpendicular to the S/C spin axis. The AP produces continuous data but at a much lower rate than the UVS. Only the downward- looking 60° of each spin will be stored. The integration time for each channel is set to 63 milliseconds which provides 32 samples per channel per spin. Data from the AP are stored in its buffer, which is emptied once per spin by the S/C microprocessor.\n\nSummary provided by http://lasp.colorado.edu/snoe/spacecraft/instruments.html\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: AP\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Solar/Space Observing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Photon/Optical Detectors\n      Short_Name: AP\n      Long_Name: AURORAL PHOTOMETER (SNOE)\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: SNOE\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://lasp.colorado.edu/snoe/spacecraft/instruments.html\n   Sample_Image: http://lasp.colorado.edu/snoe/images/AP_New.gif\n   Creation_Date: 2009-10-07\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "\nThe Advanced Microwave Moisture Sounder (AMMS) instrument ,\nwhich was mounted on NASA's DC-8 aircraft for the TOGA COARE\nField Experiment, is a scanning radiometer that measures\nbrightness temperatures in degrees Kelvin. It was operational\nduring 16 mission flights of the DC-8 between January 5 and\nFebruary 23, 1993 under the direction of Principal Investigator\nJim Wang of NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center.\n\nThe AMMS was designed to profile atmospheric water vapor and was\nmainly used for this purpose in the past. It is also sensitive\nto cloud cover and precipitation. Because the weighting\nfunctions of its four frequency channels peak at different\naltitudes, depending on water vapor density and profile, AMMS\nhas the potential of estimating the height of frozen\nhydrometeors associated with a convective storm. For TOGA COARE\nthe sensor was combined with other radiometers in the same\naircraft to measure the radiometric response of convective\nrainfall systems in the frequency range of 10-183 GHz. AMMS is\na 4-channel, mechanically scanned, imaging microwave radiometer\noperating at 92, 174, 178 and 181 GHz. It has a 15-cm aperture\ngiving an angular resolution of about 2 degrees at 92 GHz and 1\ndegree at 183 GHz. After every 6 scans, the beam is directed to\nview heated (330 K) and cooled (250 K) external calibration\ntargets for 2 seconds each, resulting in a total frame time of\n~30 secon ds (including slewing time). The radiometric signals\nand the measured physical temperatures from these calibration\ntargets form the basis for the derivation of the scene\nbrightness temperatures. The calibration accuracy is on the\norder of 1 K in the 250 - 300 K brightness temperature\nrange. The temperature sensitivity (delta T) of the sensor has\ngradually deteriorated over the past 10 years. For water vapor\nprofiling, averaging of up to 50 radiometric samples is needed\nto meet the requirement of delta T of <= 1 K. The microwave\nsignatures from precipitation are much stronger than water\nvapor at the AMMS frequencies, and data from this sensor\naveraged over a few samples will be sufficient to derive\nimportant information about the hydrometeors.\n\nThe beam is scanned in 50 steps of 1.8 degrees from nominally\n45 degrees to the right through nadir, and to 45 degrees to the\nleft with a total scan time of ~4 seconds.\n\nAdditional information available at\n\"http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/CAMPAIGN_DOCS/TOGA/amms.html\"\n\n[Summary provided by NASA]\n\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "The Multispectral Scanner (MSS) sensors were line scanning devices observing the Earth perpendicular to the orbital track. The cross-track scanning was accomplished by an oscillating mirror; six lines were scanned simultaneously in each of the four spectral bands for each mirror sweep. The forward motion of the satellite provided the along-track scan line progression.\n\nThe first five Landsats carried the MSS sensor which responded to Earth-reflected sunlight in four spectral bands. Landsat 3 carried an MSS sensor with an additional band, designated band 8, that responded to thermal (heat) infrared radiation.\n\nAn MSS scene had an Instantaneous Field Of View (IFOV) of 68 meters in the cross-track direction by 83 meters in the along-track direction (223.0 by 272.3 feet respectively). To understand this concept consider a ground scene composed of a single 83 by 83 meter area. The scan monitor sensor ensures that the cross-track optical scan is 185 km at nominal altitude regardless of mirror scan nonlinearity or other perturbations of mirror velocity.\n\nCross- track image velocity was nominally 6.82 meters per microsecond. After 9.958 microseconds, the 83 by 83 meter image has moved 67.9 meters. The sample taken at this instant represented 15 meters of previous information and 68 meters of new information.\n\nTherefore, the effective IFOV of the MSS detector in the cross-track direction was considered to be 68 meters which corresponds to a nominal picture element (pixel) ground area of 68 by 83 meters at the satellite nadir point. Using the effective IFOV in area calculation eliminates the overlap in area between adjacent pixels.\n\n[Summary provided by NASA.]\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: MSS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Imaging Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Short_Name: MSS\n      Long_Name: Multispectral Scanner\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: LANDSAT-5\n      Short_Name: LANDSAT-4\n      Short_Name: LANDSAT-2\n      Short_Name: LANDSAT-1\n      Short_Name: LANDSAT-3\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.5 μm -0.6 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.6 μm -0.7 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Near Infrared\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.7  -0.8 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Near Infrared\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.8 μm -1.1 μm\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://landsat.gsfc.nasa.gov/about/mss.html\n   Sample_Image: http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/satellite_missions/slr_sats_pics/resurs01.gif\n   Creation_Date: 2007-02-06\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 1972-07-23\n      Instrument_Owner: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "The Radar Altimeter (ALT) experiment measured (1) the spacecraft height above mean sea level and (2) the significant wave height and backscatter coefficient of the ocean surface beneath the spacecraft. The altimeter was a more accurate version of the Skylab Radar Altimeter, and was similar to the altimeter flown on GEOS 3. Two of its unique features were a linear FM transmitter with a 320-MHz bandwidth, which yielded a 3.125-ns time-delay resolution, and microprocessor-implemented closed-loop range tracking, automatic gain control, and real-time estimation of significant wave height. The instrument operated at 13.5 GHz using a 1-m parabolic antenna pointed at nadir and had a swath width which varied from 2.4 to 12 km, depending on sea state. The precision of the height measurement was 10 cm (rms). The estimate of significant wave height was accurate to 0.5 m or 10%, whichever was greater, and the ocean backscatter coefficient had an accuracy of 1 dB. For a more detailed description, see W. Townsend, \"An initial assessment of the performance achieved by the Seasat-1 radar altimeter,\" IEEE J. of Oceanic. Eng., v. OE-5, pp. 80-92, 1980. The ALT was turned on for the first time on July 3, 1978, and declared operational on July 7, 1978. The ALT operated successfully until October 10, 1978, when the spacecraft prematurely terminated the mission.

Since the\nswitch-on of the instrument in flight on 25 October l990, a steady stream of\nobservations have been made, indicating that at this phase of the solar cycle\nthe field is generally disturbed: several shock waves and a large number of\ndiscontinuities have been observed, as well as several periods with apparently\nintense wave activity. The paper gives a brief summary of the scientific\nobjectives of the investigation, followed by a detailed description of the\ninstrument and its characteristics.

The NOAA spacecraft carries two instruments to detect these emergency beacons: the Search and Rescue Repeater (SARR) provided by Canada and the Search and Rescue Processor (SARP-2) provided by France. Similar instruments are carried by the Russian COSPAS polar-orbiting satellites.\n\nThe SARR transponds the signals of 121.5, 243, and 406.05-MHz emergency beacons. However, these beacon signals are detected on the ground only when the satellite is in view of a ground station known as a Local User Terminal (LUT).\n\nThe SARP detects the signal only from 406.05-MHz beacons but stores the information for subsequent downlink to a LUT. Thus, global detection of 406.05-MHz emergency beacons is provided. This processor consists of a receiver power unit (rpu) and signal processing unit (spu).\n\nThe U.S. fishing fleet is required to carry 406.05-MHz emergency beacons. The 406.05-MHz beacons are also carried on most large international ships, some aircraft, and pleasure vessels, as well as on terrestrial carriers. The 121.5-MHz and 243-MHz beacons are required on many small aircraft with a smaller number carried on maritime vessels.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: SARR\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Positioning/Navigation\n      Short_Name: SARR\n      Long_Name: Search and Rescue Repeater\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: NOAA-19\n      Short_Name: NOAA-18\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://goespoes.gsfc.nasa.gov/poes/instruments/sarrsarp.html\n   Online_Resource: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/pod-guide/ncdc/docs/klm/html/c3/sec3-7.htm\n   Sample_Image: http://goespoes.gsfc.nasa.gov/poes/instruments/images/enlarged_sarr.jpg\n   Creation_Date: 2009-02-12\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NOAA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

Each tower module consists of interleaved planes of silicon-strip detectors and tracker tungsten converter sheets. Silicon-strip detectors are able to more precisely track the electron or positron produced from the initial gamma-ray than previous types of detectors. SSDs will have the ability to determine the location of an object in the sky to within 0.5 to 5 arc minutes. The pair conversion signature is also used to help reject the much larger background of charged cosmic rays. The high intrinsic efficiency and reliability of this technology enables straight forward event reconstruction and excellent resolution with small tails.

        skos:definition  "The Microwave Radiometer (MWR) -or Microwave Sounder (MWS)- is part of\nthe Along Track Scanning Radiometer and Microwave Sounder (ATSR)\ninstrument on-board the European Remote Sensing Satellites (ERS-1 and\nERS-2) launched by the European Space Agency on 17 July 1991 and 20\nApril 1995.\n\nThe ATSR incorporates two separate instruments: an advanced four-\nchannel infrared radiometer (the ATSR-IRR, commonly called the ATSR)\nused for measuring sea surface temperature and cloud top temperatures,\nand a two-channel Microwave Sounder (the ATSR-MWR, commonly called the\nMWR) designed to measure total precipitable water vapour and the total\nliquid water content of the atmosphere.\n\nThe MWR is a passive two-channel radiometer. The footprints of the two\nchannels are not coincident on the Earth's surface, as one channel\nviews slightly forward of the nadir point and the other slightly\nbehind, although both are on the sub_satellite track. The footprints\nare 22.4 km for the forward view and 21.2 km for the rear view, with a\n60 km separation. The calibration is achieved by ambient loads within\nthe instrument, consisting of terminated waveguides and a set of\nskyhorns viewing space.\n\nMWR characteristics:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nChannels: 23.8 and 36.5 GHz\nBeam width: 3 dB\nIFOV: 20 and 22 km\nAntenna: 60 cm off-axis paraboloid Cassegrain\nReceiver: Dicke\n------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nThe ATSR was designed to provide the following:\n\n\n- global sea surface temperature, accurate to better than\n0.5K (absolute) with a spatial resolution of 50 Km in\nconditions of up to 80% cloud cover\n- images of surface temperature, accurate to 0.1K\n(relative) with 1 km resolution and 500 km swath width\n- total water vapour content of the atmosphere\n- observations of clouds, aerosols, haze, land-ice and\nsea-ice surface emissivity\n- tropospheric range correction of the radar altimeter\nmeasurements to better than 5 cm\n\n\nThe ATSR provides important information in scientific disciplines such\nas oceanography, climatology and meteorology. When combined with\nobservations of cloud top temperatures, cloud cover, haze, aerosol and\ntotal water vapour content of the atmosphere, significant improvements\nmay be expected in the accuracy of medium range weather\nforecasting. Also accurate sea surface temperatures can be of use to a\nnumber of commercial users, particularly those involved in fishing and\nthe management of fishing areas. In the field of research, potential\napplications of the ATSR include distinguishing thin new ice from open\nwater, identifying surface type, and the accumulation rate of land\nice.\n\nOnline sensor information:\n\"http://www.arm.gov/docs/instruments/static/mwr.html\"\n\nRelated URL: \"http://earth.esa.int/mwr/\"\n\nReference online documentation:\n\"http://earth.esa.int/services/esa_doc/doc_ats.html\"\n\nFor any query, please refer to:\n\nESA/ESRIN Earth Observation Help Desk\n\n\"http://earth.esa.int\"\n\nE-mail: eohelp&#64esa.int\n\nPhone: +39 06 94180777\n\nFax: +39 06 94180292\n\nAddress:\n\nESA/ESRIN\n\nVia G.Galilei\n\n00044 Frascati\n\nItaly\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "Radar instrumentation consists of (1) a duel-mode very high-frequency (VHF) (120 to 300 MHz) synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) that can operate in bistatic or monostatic mode for simultaneously measuring ice thickness, mapping internal layers at depth and imaging the ice-bed interface, and (2) an ultra high-frequency (UHF) ultra-wideband radar (500 to 2000 MHz) for fine-resolution mapping of near-surface internal layers. One important application of the SAR is the determination of basal conditions, particularly the presence and distribution of basal water. Basal water lubricates the ice/bed interface, enhancing flow, and increasing the amount of ice discharged into the ocean. Another application of the SAR will be to measure ice thickness and map internal layers in both shallow and deep ice. Information on near-surface internal layers will be used to estimate the average, recent accumulation rate, while the deeper layers provide a history of past accumulation and flow rates. A tracked vehicle and an automated rover was used to test and demonstrate the utility of an intelligent radar in glaciological investigations.\n\nThe system was developed to collect, process and analyze data in real time, and to use a priori information derived from archived sources for decision making. The combined real time and archived information can be used onboard the vehicles to select and generate an optimum sensor configuration. This project thus involves innovative research in intelligent systems, sounding radars and ice sheet modeling. In addition it has a very strong public outreach and education program, which include near-real-time image broadcasts via the world wide web \n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: IMAGING RADAR SYSTEMS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Active Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Imaging Radars\n      Short_Name: IMAGING RADAR SYSTEMS\n      Long_Name: Imaging Radar Systems, Real and Synthetic Aperture\n   End_Group\n   Group: Instrument_Associated_Sensors\n      Short_Name: Wideband UHF radar\n      Short_Name: SAR\n      Short_Name: RADAR ECHO SOUNDERS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: FIELD SURVEYS\n      Short_Name: FIELD INVESTIGATION\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Microwave\n      Number_Channels: 1\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 120 - 300 MHz\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Microwave\n      Number_Channels: 1\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 500 - 2000 MHz\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: https://www.cresis.ku.edu/\n   Sample_Image: http://www.cresis.ku.edu/images/SAR_radar.jpg\n   Creation_Date: 2007-12-04\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Data_Rate: 18 Mbps\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 2005-07-20\n      Instrument_Stop_Date: 2005-07-23\n      Instrument_Owner: Prasad Gogineni\n   End_Group\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Data_Rate: 18 Mbps\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 2006-01-01\n      Instrument_Stop_Date: 2006-01-10\n      Instrument_Owner: Prasad Gogineni\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "The Wind Imaging Interferometer (WINDII) on UARS determined \ntemperature and winds in the mesosphere and the lower thermosphere by \nmeasuring both Doppler widths and shifts of isolated spectral lines \nemitted by airglow and aurora. The principal objectives were (1) \nmeasure 2-dimensional vertical profiles of horizontal wind velocity \nand Doppler temperature of the neutral atmosphere from 70 to 310 km as \na function of latitude and time, (2) measure the global distribution \nof small-scale wave-like structures on a 3 km scale, and (3) studied \nthe dynamic and thermal aspects of the neutral atmospheric energy \nbalance. The WINDII instrument viewed the atmospheric limb \nsimultaneously in two directions, 45 degrees and 135 degrees from the \nvelocity vector. An imaging detector provided simultaneous \nmeasurements of temperature and wind profiles over the instrument's \nentire altitude range (70 to 310 km) with a vertical resolution of 2 \nkm and horizontal resolution of 20 to 100 km. Emission lines of OI, \nOH, O+ and O2 were measured to cover both daytime and nighttime over \nthe altitude range and provide thermospheric ion wind velocities. The \ninstrument was basically a CCD camera which viewed the Earth's limb \nthrough a field-widened Michelson interferometer. The instrument took \n4 images with the interferometer optical path difference changed by \n1/4 wavelength between images. From these images, the fringe phase \n(leading to wind velocity), fringe modulation (leading to \ntemperature), and emission rate was determined. The Michelson optics \nconsisted of a cemented glass hexagonal beamsplitter, a glass block \nwith a deposited mirror and a glass block combined with an air gap and \na piezoelectrically driven mirror. The CCD camera consisted of a fast \ncamera lens and a 320 x 256 pixel detector array cooled to -50 C. \nInterference filters were mounted in a temperature-controlled filter \nwheel assembly to isolate specific spectral lines. \n\nSee \nReber, Carl A.,\"The Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite\",Trans., Am.

        skos:definition  "The Advanced Microwave Radiometer (AMR), is an enhanced version of the Jason-1 Microwave Radiometer (JMR). Like the JMR, it acquires measurements via three separate frequency channels to determine the path delay of the altimeter's radar caused by atmospheric water vapor. This instrument measures radiation from Earth's surface at three frequencies (18, 21 and 37 GHz). Measurements acquired at each frequency are combined to determine atmospheric water vapor and liquid water content. Once the water content is known, we can determine the correction to be applied for radar signal path delays.\n\nAdditional information on the AMR is available on the AVISO site. \n\n[Description Source:  NASA JPL Ocean Surface Topography from Space Home Page]\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: AMR\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Radiometers\n      Short_Name: AMR\n      Long_Name: Advanced Microwave Radiometer\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: OSTM/JASON-2\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Microwave\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 18.7, 23.8, and 34 GHz\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://sealevel.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/ostm-sc-inst.html\n   Online_Resource: http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com/en/missions/current-missions/jason-2/instruments/amr/index.html\n   Sample_Image: http://www.aviso.oceanobs.com/typo3temp/pics/97616634ad.jpg\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-10\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

AMSU-A is a 15-channel microwave sounder that obtains temperature profiles in the upper atmosphere and provides a cloud-filtering capability for the AIRS infrared channels for increased accuracy of tropospheric temperature observations. The fifteen AMSU-A channels have a 3.3&#176; beam width, resulting in a nominal horizontal spatial resolution of 40.5 km at nadir.\n\nChannels 3 to 14 on AMSU-A are situated on the low-frequency side of the oxygen resonance band (50 ~ 60 GHz) and are used for temperature sounding. Successive channels in this band are situated at frequencies with increasing opacity and therefore respond to radiation from increasing altitudes. Channel 1, located on the first (weak) water vapor resonance line, is used to obtain estimates of total column water vapor in the atmosphere. Channel 2 (at 31 GHz) is used to indicate the presence of rain. Channel 15 on AMSU-A, at 89 GHz, is used as an indicator for precipitation, using the fact that at 89 GHz ice more strongly scatters radiation than it absorbs or emits radiation.\n\nThe AMSU is currently operational on the NOAA-15 polar orbiting satellite (launched 13 May 1998), the NOAA-16 polar orbiting satellite (launched 21 September 2000), the NASA EOS Aqua (formally PM-1) spacecraft (launched 4 May 2002), the NOAA-17 polar orbiting satellite (launched 21 May 2002), the NOAA-18 polar orbiting satellite (launched 20 May 2005), the NOAA-19 polar orbiting satellite (launched 06 February 2009), and the METOP-B satellite (launched 17 September 2012).

        skos:definition  "The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) is a core European Space Agency (ESA) instrument on the ENVISAT spacecraft (launched March 1, 2002). The primary objective of MERIS is to monitor ocean color and marine biophysical parameters in oceans and coastal regions with applications to land and atmospheric processes. MERIS is a passive push-broom optical system using Charge Coupled Devices (CCDs) at high spectral resolution (5-20 nm) in 15 channels from0.405 to 1.030 micrometers with a swath width of 1500 km.  MERIS performed simultaneous spatial and spectral imaging. Spatial imaging is performed in a push-broom mode and spectral imaging is performed by diffraction grating dispersion. MERIS images are converted into electrical signals using CCDs. MERIS operates in two modes: Full Resolution (Direct Transmission) Mode and Low Resolution (Average Transmission) Mode. Full resolution mode uses 15 channels with a resolution of 0.25 x 0.25 km and a spectral resolution of 2.5 nm. Data will be relayed directly to the ground station in this mode and is not stored on-board. Low Resolution Mode uses 15 channels with a spatial resolution of 1 x 1 km and a spectral resolution of 2.5 nm.  The MERIS imaging system consists of six overlapping optical modules, each with a 14 degree FOV. The FOV is deflected in the along-track direction by a depointing mirror. The ground imager receives light from the Earth and formed an Earth image on the entrance slit of the spectrometer. The spectrometer then dispersed the light onto an area array CCD. The spectrometer is comprised of a refracting block and a concave reflecting diffraction grating. All 15 MERIS channels are programmable in width and wavelength. On-board calibration is performed by seperate light sources and through the use of the depointing mirror as a shutter. All of the mechanical, thermal electronic and optical devices are mounted externally to the platform. MERIS is operated synergistically with the RA-2, ASAT, and AATSR instruments.\n\nFor more information on MERIS, link to\nhttp://wdc.dlr.de/sensors/meris/\n\nFor more information on ENVISAT, link to\nhttp://envisat.esa.int/\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: MERIS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Imaging Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Short_Name: MERIS\n      Long_Name: Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: ENVISAT\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Number_Channels: 15\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Near Infrared\n      Number_Channels: 15\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.4-1.5um\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://envisat.esa.int/instruments/meris\n   Online_Resource: http://wdc.dlr.de/sensors/meris/\n   Sample_Image: http://envisat.esa.int/instruments/tour-index/hardware_img/x_Meris50.jpg\n   Creation_Date: 2007-09-17\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Data_Rate: 1.5 Mbytes/s\n      Instrument_Owner: ESA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "The Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SSBUV) instrument was\ndesigned to measure ozone concentrations by comparing solar\nultraviolet radiation with radiation scattered back from the Earth's\natmosphere.  SSBUV was first flown in 1989 and has been flown a total\nof seven times on the Space Shuttle including all three Atmospheric\nLaboratory for Applications and Science (ATLAS) missions.\nSSBUV compares the observations of several ozone measuring instruments\naboard the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration NOAA-9 and\nNOAA-11 satellites, the Russian Meteor-3/TOMS satellite and the Upper\nAtmosphere Research Satellite (UARS). The SSBUV data are used to\ncalibrate the instruments to ensure the most accurate readings\npossible for the detection of atmospheric ozone trends.\nSSBUV's impact on NASA's ability to detect ozone trends accurately was\nrealized after approximately four flights. Data from the first flight\nwith an earlier satellite already have been used to estimate ozone\ntrends in the upper stratosphere since 1980. These results show a\ndepletion of about 8 percent over 10 years, which is consistent with\npredictions of ozone depletion.\nSSBUV has achieved one of it's primary objectives using data from the\nfirst three flights, flown in 1989, 1990 and 1991. These data have\nbeen used to update the calibration of the NOAA-11 SBUV/2 ozone\ninstrument which has been in orbit since late 1988. The NOAA ozone\ndata have been reprocessed with a refined algorithm and new\ncalibration factors based on SSBUV and SBUV/2 in- flight calibration\ndata, which were provided by NASA. The reprocessing covers the period\n1989 to 1993. The reprocessed data have been checked against ground-\nbased ozone observations, and these comparisons show very good\nagreement. There is also now excellent consistency between the refined\nNOAA-11 SBUV/2 data and the Nimbus-7 SBUV/TOMS data set, which goes\nback to 1978.  The combined 15-year data set represents an excellent\nresource for ozone climate and trend studies.\nSSBUV has detected and verified a significant decrease in the amounts\nof total Northern Hemisphere between the STS-45/ATLAS-1 (March 1992)\nand STS-56/ ATLAS-2 (March 1993) missions. The depletion also was\ndetected simultaneously by satellites and ground-based\nobservations. Indications are that total ozone decreased during the\nsame period on the order of 10 to 15 percent at mid- latitudes in the\nNorthern Hemisphere. Scientists believe that this significant\ndepletion results from the combined residual effects of Mt.  Pinatubo\naerosols in the stratosphere and cold stratosphere temperatures during\nthe winter of 1992/ 93.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: SSBUV\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Solar/Space Observing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Ultraviolet Instruments\n      Short_Name: SSBUV\n      Long_Name: Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

SMAP will use a combined radiometer and high-resolution radar to measure surface soil moisture and freeze-thaw state, providing for scientific advances and societal benefits. Direct measurements of soil moisture and freeze/thaw state are needed to improve our understanding of regional water cycles, ecosystem productivity, and processes that link the water, energy, and carbon cycles. Soil moisture information at high resolution enables improvements in weather forecasts, flood and drought forecasts, and predictions of agricultural productivity and climate change.\n\nThe National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) Integrated Program Office (IPO) has developed a tri-agency set of requirements for the next generation of polar-orbiting operational environmental satellites. A novel approach combining radar-radiometer and L-band mapping of global soil moisture will allow SMAP to far exceed the NPOESS soil moisture threshold (minimum performance) requirements for sensing depth and spatial resolution. With \"fast-track\" development, it is possible that SMAP could provide critical gap-filling soil moisture measurements for NPOESS, which were lost when the Conical Microwave Imager/Sounder was cancelled from the first NPOESS platform.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: SMAP L-BAND RADAR\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Active Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Imaging Radars\n      Short_Name: SMAP L-BAND RADAR\n      Long_Name: SMAP L-Band Radar\n   End_Group\n   Group: Instrument_Associated_Sensors\n      Short_Name: SMAP L-BAND RADIOMETER\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: SMAP\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 1.26 GHz\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/smap \n   Online_Resource: http://smap.jpl.nasa.gov/\n   Online_Resource: http://nasascience.nasa.gov/earth-science/decadal-surveys\n   Online_Resource: http://eospso.gsfc.nasa.gov/eos_homepage/mission_profiles/show_mission.php?id=72\n   Creation_Date: 2009-09-23\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "     Vertical profiles of salinity and temperature in the ocean\nhave been obtained by a variety of instruments, referred to here\ngenerically as STDs or (when the salinity is obtained by way of the\nwater's conductivity) CTDs.  Data described in the Master Directory\nhave in some cases been obtained over considerable periods of time\nand by a variety of investigators.  Hence, the specifics of the\nSTDs vary considerably - sometimes within the same data set.\n     For descriptions of the instrumental sources and\ncharacteristics of a particular data set, investigators will have\nto contact the appropriate archive.  The brief sketch of salinity,\nSTDs and CTDs given below is taken from a standard and well-\naccepted text in descriptive physical oceanography.  It is intended\nfor those not already familiar with the field.\n      Temperature and depth are physical parameters common to all\nscience - indeed common to ordinary language; salinity is much more\nspecialized.  The total amount of dissolved material in sea-water\nis termed the 'salinity' and is defined as 'the total amount of\nsolid materials in grams contained in one kilogram of sea-water\nwhen all the carbonate has been converted to oxide, the bromine and\niodine replaced by chlorine and all organic matter completely\noxidized'.  For example, the average salinity of ocean water is\nabout 35 gm/km of sea water, usually stated as 'thirty-five parts\nper thousand'.  One of the more remarkable features of sea-water is\nthat while the total concentration of dissolved salts varies from\nplace to place, the ratios of the more abundant components remain\nalmost constant.\n     The direct determination of salinity by evaporating sea-water\nto dryness is too difficult to carry out as a routine process.\nInstead, the classical (Knudsen) method of measurement exploits the\nobserved invariance of component ratios.  One first determines the\nchlorinity by titration with standard silver nitrate solution and\nthen scales up to the salinity by a relation based on the measured\nratio of chloride ion to total dissolved substances:\n     Salinity = 1.80655 X Chlorinity\nIn routine use, an accuracy of 0.02 parts per thousand is\nconsidered reasonable for this laboratory technique.  More advanced\nlab procedures easily yield accuracies of 0.003 parts per thousand.\n     In the 1960s inductive salinometers were developed for in situ\nuse and a number of such instruments are now available.  Because\nthey measure Conductivity, Temperature and Dept, they are generally\nreferred to as CTD instruments.  Accuracies of 0.005 parts per\nthousand, 0.005 degrees C and 0.15% of full scale depth are claimed\n(Pickard, p.93).

        skos:definition  "\nThe Compact Airborne Spectrographic Imager (CASI) is an imaging\nspectrometer designed and built by Itres Ltd of Calgary, Canada, and\nis flown on aircraft.\n\nIt works on the principle of a series of lines of charged coupled\ndevices (CCDs) which each produce an electrical charge dependant upon\nthe amount of light energy falling upon them.  These are packed\ntogether into a 3 dimensional array made up of 288 x 512 CCDs.\nUpwelling light radiation from beneath the aircraft is focused onto\nthe array by a compound lens.\n\nLight entering the system is split into a number of wavebands, each\nregistering on a different CCD or row of CCDs. As the aircraft travels\nforward, light reflected from a succession of small areas fall onto\nthe array and is split into its wavebands. The minimum size (pixel\nsize) of the areas recorded in the routine coastal surveys was 8m x\n8m.  Other pixel sizes can be recorded by altering height, speed and\nthe focal length of the lens.\n\nThe CASI can be operated continuously in 2 modes and intermittently in\na third.  In the spatial mode, the CASI records data in up to 19\nselected spectral channels from all the pixels across the swath.\nWaveband channels can be selected for specific environmental\nparameters (such as chlorophyll, vegetation, etc.).\n\nThe CASI can also be used in the spectral mode, recording data from\nacross the whole spectrum over 288 wavebands but only for a limited\nnumber of pixels across the swath. This mode also allows the\ncollection of spatial mode data in a single waveband to aid in the\nlocation of the spectral data.\n\nFinally, the CASI can also be used in short bursts in an enhanced\nspectral mode to record up to 74 channels over a 300 pixel wide swath.\nThis acts as a middle ground between spectral and spatial modes.\n\nA PCI image processing package reads and displays CASI data directly\nin full 16 bit resolution to produce high resolution images.\n\n[This description was obtained from the UK Environment Agency.]\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "\nMAMS is a multispectral scanner which measures reflected radiation\nfrom the Earth's surface and clouds in eight visible/near-infrared\nbands, and thermal emission from the Earth's surface, clouds, and\natmospheric constituents (primarily water vapor) in four infrared\nbands. The 5.0 mRa aperture of MAMS produces an instantaneous\nfield-of-view (IFOV) resolution of 100 m at nadir from the nominal\nER-2 altitude of 20 km. The width of the entire cross path\nfield-of-view scanned by the sensor is 37 km, thereby providing\ndetailed resolution of atmospheric and surface features across the\nswath width and along the aircraft flight track. For clouds and\nthunderstorm features the IFOV decreases with increasing cloud height\nby a factor of (Z-20)/20, where Z is the cloud height in kilometers.\n\nThe MAMS 6.5 micrometer channel has been used to map variations in\nupper tropospheric water vapor associated with a variety of\natmospheric disturbances. The upper tropospheric water vapor imagery\nfrom VAS and the new GOES imager and sounder is very useful in the\nstudy of upper-level dynamics of mid-latitude weather systems. This is\nreadily apparent in video \"loops\" of this from the satellite channel,\nwhich show smooth flowing patterns associated with large-scale weather\ndisturbances. Changes in the brightness of the water vapor features\nare related to the vertical distribution of water vapor in the middle\nand upper troposphere, the integrated water vapor amount, and to a\nlesser degree the temperature profile. In addition, water vapor\nimagery can be used to discern small-scale variability of high clouds\n(particularly cirrus) and clear air atmospheric water vapor fields. In\nparticular, MAMS water vapor imagery has been used to map clear air\nmoisture variations in a number of different applications including\nlee wave situations.\n\nThe split-window channels from MAMS are similar to those from the\nAdvanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), VAS, and GOES-8/9/10\nimager and sounder. The 11 micrometer channels of MAMS and VAS are\nvery similar, while those of AVHRR and the GOES-8/9/10 imager and\nsounder are narrower and shifted toward shorter wavelengths. The 12\nmicrometer channel of AVHRR is positioned near 11.8 micrometer with a\nbandwidth about twice that of MAMS and VAS (which are centered at\nlonger wavelengths). The GOES-8/9/10 imager and sounder 12 micrometer\nchannels are also narrow when compared to AVHRR. One of the sounder 12\nmicrometer channels and the imager 12 micrometer channel are centered\nnear 12.0 micrometer, while the other sounder channel is near 12.7\nmicrometers.  These 12 micrometer channels measure upwelling radiation\nwhere water vapor and other constituent absorption (particularly, by\nthe Q-branch of CO2 at 12.63 micrometers) are more significant. The\nspectral differences of the 12 micrometer channels produce small\ndifferences in brightness temperatures for VAS and MAMS, but somewhat\nlarger differences between AVHRR and MAMS (or VAS).\n\nMore Information: \"http://www.ghcc.msfc.nasa.gov/irgrp/aircraft.html\"\n\n[Adapted from NASA/MSFC/GHCC Homepage]\n"@en ;

There were two detectors measuring electrons and protons\nfrom 0.2 to 25 keV in 16 logarithmically spaced steps, and one detector\nmeasuring 5 keV electrons continuously. Each detector consisted of a\ncylindrical electrostatic analyzer for species and energy selection, and a\nSpiraltron electron multiplier for particle detection. Energy distributions\nwere obtained by applying different fixed or stepped voltages to the deflection\nplates. Distributions in angle were measured using the spacecraft spin and the\nanalyzers' positions on the spacecraft. In the despun modes, measurements were\nobtained at 45 deg to the spacecraft equator, and radially away from the earth.\nDetector look angles were chosen to give optimum magnetic pitch-angle coverage\nwhen the spacecraft was moving either poleward or equatorward. All detectors\nwere identical in construction and used 1- x 6-mm entrance apertures. Counts\nwere accumulated over 55.7 ms and read out each main telemetry frame (62.5 ms).\nThe two stepped detectors moved one energy step once each main frame with the\nsame accumulation time, requiring about 1 s for a complete cycle of steps. More\ncomplete details of this experiment may be found in R. A. Hoffman et al., Radio\nSci., v. 8, n. 4, p. 393, 1973. NSSDC has all the useful data that exist from\nthis investigation.

Beginning with the launch of the DMSP F-16 satellite on 18 October 2003, the SSMIS marks the commencement of a new series of passive microwave conically scanning imagers and sounders planned for launch over the next two decades (Sun and Weng 2008). SSMIS improves upon the surface and atmospheric retrievals of the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), and upon the atmospheric temperature and water vapor sounding capabilities of both the Special Sensor Microwave Temperature Sounder (SSM/T-1) and the Special Sensor Microwave Humidity Sounder (SSM/T-2). Furthermore, the SSMIS imaging and sounding sensors share the same viewing geometry, thereby allowing surface parameters to be retrieved simultaneously (Yan and Weng 2008). The SSMIS instrument is able to estimate atmospheric temperature, moisture, and surface parameters from data collected at frequencies ranging from 19 to 183 GHz over a swath width of 1707 km. SSMIS is currently carried aboard DMSP-F16, -F17, and -F18 satellites, and is slated for furture missions aboard DMSP-F19 and -F20.

        skos:definition  "The Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar\n(SIR-C/X-SAR) was flown as part of the Space Radar Laboratory-1\npayload launched on the Space Shuttle STS-59 on April 9, 1994.\nThe objectives of the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C) instrument were\nto investigate characteristics of the Earth&#039;s surface such as (1)\nvegetation extent and biomass condition, (2) soil moisture and snow\nproperties, (3) recent climate change and tectonic activity, and (4)\nocean wave spectra. The SIR-C was jointly operated from the Space\nShuttle with the X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (X-SAR), provided by the\nGerman Space Agency (DARA)/German Aerospace Research Establishment\n(DLR) and the Italian Space Agency (ASI), on the same Space Radar Laboratory\n(SRL) platform. The SIR-C radar operated at L-band (24-cm wavelength or\n1250 MHz) and C-band (5.6-cm wavelength or 5300 MHz) in multiple polarization\nmodes (HH,HV,VH,VV). The antenna was composed of two planar arrays, one for\nL-band and one for C-band, in dual-polarized operation. Each array was\ncomposed of a uniform grid of dual-polarized microstrip antenna radiators.\nThe SIR-C antenna was 12.2 meters, weighed over 10,500 kg and filled the\nShuttle cargo bay. SIR-C provided images of the magnitudes of HH,VV,and\ncross-polarized returns, images of the relative phase difference between\nmultiple polarization returns, and derivation of linear, circular, or\nelliptical polarization. Image resolution was 25 m (20 MHz bandwidth) and\n40 m (10 MHz bandwidth). The swath width ranged from 15 to 65 km for\ncalibrated images and 40 to 90 km for mapping mode (SCANSAR) images.\nIn SCANSAR mode, the antenna was steered electronically or mechanically to\nacquire data at various incidence angles (15 to 55 degrees) increasing the\nswath width at reduced resolution. Data was acquired at 8 bits per sample or\n4 bits per sample in 16 primary modes. SIR-C used four solid state receivers,\ntwo each for C-band and L-band. The SIR-C data was recorded on-board on the\nShuttle Payload High Rate Recorder. The SIR program is an extension of the\nSeasat SAR, SIR-A, and SIR-B instruments.\nX-SAR operated at X-band (3.1-cm wavelength or 9600 MHz) with VV\npolarization. The X-SAR used a passive slotted-waveguide antenna (12\nmeters) which was tilted mechanically to align the X-band beam with\nthe SIR-C C-band and L-band beams. The swath width was from 10 to 45\nkm at 25-km resolution with illumination angle of 15 to 60 degrees\noff-nadir. The X-SAR antenna had a fixed beamwidth of 5.8 degrees in\nelevation and 0.13 degrees in azimuth as opposed to the phased array,\nmulti-polarization antenna of SIR-C. X-SAR data was recorded on-board\non the Shuttle Payload High Rate Recorder and transmitted in real-time\n(Ku-band via TDRSS) over selected regions. The X-SAR is a follow-on\nthe Germany&#039;s Microwave Remote Sensing Experiment (MRSE), flown on the\nfirst Shuttle Spacelab mission in 1983. The SRL is expected to fly\nagain in 1994 and 1995.\nThe SIR-C/X-SAR Science Team was made up of 49 members and 3\nassociates from 13 countries. Data was collected and focused on\nselected supersites in conjunction with aircraft and ground-based\nobservations. See Jordan,R.L., B.L.Huneycutt, and M.Werner, &The\nSIR-C/X-SAR Synthetic Aperture Radar System&, Vol.79, No.6, June\n1991.\nThere were more than 400 sites on Earth where data was taken during\nthe mission.

These data are being used to measure the Earth's total thermal radiation budget, and, in combination with MODIS data, detailed information about clouds. The first CERES instrument was launched on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite in November 1997 as CERES-PFM; the second and third CERES instuments were launched on the Terra satellite in December 1999 as CERES-FM1 AND -FM2; and the fourth and fifth CERES instruments are on board the Aqua satellite, as CERES-FM3 and CERES-FM4.\n\nAqua carries two CERES instruments, the fourth and fifth CERES to fly in space.  The TRMM and Terra CERES have obtained levels of accuracy never before achieved for comprehensive Earth radiation-budget measurements. All the CERES instruments have the capability of operating in either of two scanning modes: fixed azimuth plane scanning, where the scan lines are perpendicular to the path of the satellite, and rotating azimuth plane scanning, where the scan lines are at wide range of angles with respect to the satellite's path. The paired CERES on Terra and on Aqua provide both of those missions with the possibility of coincident fixed azimuth plane scanning from one CERES and rotating azimuth plane scanning from the other CERES, enhancing the quality of the final products.\n\nSEE ALSO: CERES-PFM, CERES-FM1, CERES-FM2.\n\nInformation obtained from http://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/aqua_ceres.php\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: CERES-FM3\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Radiometers\n      Short_Name: CERES-FM3\n      Long_Name: Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System - Flight Model 3\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: AQUA\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Number_Channels: 1\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.2 μm - 100 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Infrared > Reflected\n      Number_Channels: 1\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.2 μm - 3.5 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Infrared > Thermal\n      Number_Channels: 1\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 6 μm - 25 μm\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/aqua_ceres.php\n   Online_Resource: http://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/\n   Sample_Image: http://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/aqua/ceres_inst.jpg\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-25\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

Significant obstacles which have\npreviously made this task impossible include the low density and energy of the\noutflowing ionospheric plasma plume and the positive spacecraft floating\npotentials which exclude the low-energy plasma from detection on ordinary\nspacecraft. Based on a unique combination of focusing electrostatic ion optics\nand time of 3 flight detection and mass analysis, TIDE provides the\nunprecedented sensitivity (seven channels at 0.1 cm2 sr each) and resolution\nrequired for this purpose. PSI will produce a low energy plasma locally at the\nPOLAR spacecraft which will provide the ion current required to balance the\nphotoelectron current, along with a low temperature electron population, thus\nregulating the spacecraft potential at a few tenths of a volt positive relative\nto the space plasma.\nFor more information, see:\nhttp://satyr.msfc.nasa.gov/TIDE/\nand\nhttp://pwg.gsfc.nasa.gov/polar/polar_inst.shtml\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: TIDE\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Solar/Space Observing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Particle Detectors\n      Short_Name: TIDE\n      Long_Name: Thermal Ion Dynamics Experiment\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: POLAR\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://xd12srv1.nsstc.nasa.gov/ssl/PAD/sppb/index_Tide.html\n   Online_Resource: http://tide.gsfc.nasa.gov/\n   Sample_Image: http://xd12srv1.nsstc.nasa.gov/ssl/PAD/sppb/TIDE/images/plate_1_lrg.gif\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 1996-02-24\n      Instrument_Owner: SW Research Labs\n      Instrument_Owner: Los Alamos National Lab\n      Instrument_Owner: Centre d'etude des Environnements Terrestre et Planetaires, France\n      Instrument_Owner: Hughes Research Labs\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

The principal investigators for MAS are Dr. Michael King (NASA/GSFC) and Dr. Paul Menzel (NOAA/NESDIS).\n\nThe modified Wildfire instrument was first flown in 1991 in the FIRE Cirrus-II experiment onboard a NASA ER-2 over Kansas and the Gulf coast area.  The Wildfire instrument was re-configured to the MAS in 1992 and was flown over the Atlantic Ocean as part of the ASTEX experiment.  During 1993, MAS was flown in the southwestern Pacific during TOGA/COARE and CEPEX experiments.  In July 1993, MAS was flown over the northeastern United States during the SCAR-A experiment.  The MAS is a 50-band spectrometer, but before mid-1994, only 12 bands were used at 8 bit resolution. By October 1999,the MAS was recording information in all 50 visible and infrared spectral bands at 16-bit resolution.  From January 1995 to October 1999, the 16 bits resolution was compressed into a 12 bit format.\n\nDetails of the MAS instrument and data calibration can be found in the MAS level-1B Data User's Guide at http://mas.arc.nasa.gov/reference/guide.html\n\nInformation about the MAS data and experiments can be found on the MAS\nHome Page at: http://mas.arc.nasa.gov/\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: MAS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Imaging Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Short_Name: MAS\n      Long_Name: MODIS Airborne Simulator\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: NASA ER-2\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://mas.arc.nasa.gov/reference/guide.html\n   Online_Resource: http://mas.arc.nasa.gov/\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "\nNASA's Atmospheric Effects of Aviation Program (AEAP) is charged\nwith the effects of aircraft on climate and on the chemistry of\nthe atmosphere. Much of this effort has been dedicated to\ninterpretation of atmospheric observations and prediction of\nthe impact of future aircraft fleets using two-and\nthree-dimensional models. However, some of the information\nneeded to assess aircraft impacts is lacking. In response, the\nTropospheric Ozone and Tracers from Commercial Aircraft\nPlatforms (TOTCAP) project was conceived as a means to gather a\nlong-term data set that would address transport in the\ntropopause region. Students in Linnea Avallone's group and LASP\ntechnical staff have designed and tested a suite of instruments\nthat measures several trace gases. Although ultimately this\ninstrument package will be flown on commercial (revenue)\naircraft, it was initially deployed on NASA's DC-8 flying\nlaboratory during the SOLVE campaign to study ozone loss in the\nnorthern hemisphere. Four i ndependent chemical sensors are\npackaged into a single unit that operates autonomously.\n\nMeasurements of ozone (by ultraviolet absorption), water vapor\n(by near-infrared tunable diode laser spectroscopy), carbon\ndioxide (by near-infrared absorption), and short-lived\nhalocarbons (by gas chromatography) are made continuously\nduring aircraft flight, every second for O3, H2O and CO2, and\nevery four minutes for halocarbons. The wide range of lifetimes\nand source/sink processes for these compounds provide the means\nto assess the relative importance of various transport\nprocesses in determining the chemical composition of the\ntropopause region. A more complete understanding of these\nprocesses (e.g., convection, stratosphere-troposphere exchange)\nis essential to the construction of realistic atmospheric\nmodels that are used to assess the impact of aviation. Until\napplications on commercial aircraft become a reality, the\ninstruments will be used in other projects to study chemistry\nand transport in the troposphere.\n\nAdditional information available at\n\"http://lasp.colorado.edu/programs_missions/present/totcap/\"\n\n[Summary provided by University of Colorado]\n\n\n"@en ;

This experiment will provide: \n\n- continuous data at 3,4 or 6 vectors/sec, and\n- snapshot memory data and Fast Fourier Transform data (FFT) based on\n24 vectors/sec. acquired on board, working synchronously with blocks\nof 512 samples (FFT only) each.\n\nThese measurements will be precise, accurate, and ultra sensitive. The basic\ninstrument is a twin triaxial fluxgate magnetometer system. Each of two\nidentical sensors is on booms that extend past the end of diametrically\nopposite solar panels. The digital processing unit utilizes a 12 bit A/D\nconverter to easily resolve small amplitude fluctuations of the field, and is\nmicroprocessor controlled. It also incorporates a dedicated FFT processor\ndeveloped around high performance DSP integrated circuits, which produces a 32\nchannel logarithmic spectrum for each axis, synthesized from a \"raw\" 256 point\nlinear spectrum. All components of the power spectral matrices corresponding to\nthe 32 estimates are transmitted to the ground once every 80 seconds, providing\npower and phase information together with the corresponding snapshot memory\ntime series data. As in previous instruments developed at GSFC, high\nreliability is obtained by the use of fully redundant systems and extremely\nconservative designs. The intrinsic zero drift of the sensors is expected to be\nbelow 0.1 nT over periods of up to 6 months. Electrical \"flippers\" designed to\nsimulate a 180 degree mechanical rotation of the sensors, will be used to\nmonitor the zero level drift associated with aging of electronic components.\nThe use of advanced statistical techniques for estimating absolute zero levels\nis also planned. The instruments feature a very wide dynamic range of\nmeasurements capability, from B1 4 nT up to B1 65,536 nT per axis in eight\ndiscrete ranges; all ranges can be activated either by command or, most\ncommonly, automatically.

These include\nwork at New Mexico State University, the University of New Hampshire, the\nUniversity of Maryland, the University of Iowa, Nagoya University, the\nUniversity of Tasmania and NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center.\n\nThe GME instrument has provided continuous observations extending over almost a\ncomplete heliospheric cycle from launch in October 1973 to 2001. When combined\nwith the data from essentially identical Goddard experiments on IMP 6 and 7,\nthese cosmic ray and energetic interplanetary particle observations span a\nperiod of 26 years. Data from the GME instrument span an energy range of\n0.5-450 MeV Hydrogen, 2-450 MeV/nuc Helium, ions from Carbon through the Iron\ngroup from several to >100 MeV/nuc and relativistic electrons. The quality of\nthe IMP 8 GME data in terms of particle and energy resolution, and sensitivity,\nfor galactic cosmic ray Hydrogen (2-230 MeV) and Helium (2-450 MeV/nuc) remains\ncomparable to that of any other cosmic ray experiment flown since 1971.\n\nThe GSFC cosmic-ray experiment was designed to measure energy spectra,\ncomposition, and angular distributions of solar and galactic electrons,\nprotons, and heavier nuclei up to Z=30. Three distinct detector systems were\nused. The first system consisted of a pair of solid-state telescopes that\nmeasured integral fluxes of electrons above 150, 350, and 700 keV and of\nprotons above .05, .15, .50, .70, 1.0, 1.2, 2.0, 2.5, 5.0, 15, and 25 MeV.\nExcept for the .05-MeV proton mode, all counting modes had unique species\nidentification. The second detector system was a solid-state dE/dx vs E\ntelescope that looked perpendicular to the spin axis. This telescope measured\nZ=1 to 16 nuclei with energies between 4 and 20 MeV/nucleon. Counts of\nparticles in the 0.5- to 4-MeV/nucleon range, with no charge resolution, were\nobtained as counts in the dE/dx sensor but not in the E sensor. The third\ndetector system was a three-element telescope whose axis made an angle of 39\ndeg with respect to the spin axis. The middle element was a CsI scintillator,\nwhile the other two elements were solid-state sensors. The instrument responded\nto electrons between 2 and 12 MeV and to Z=1 to 30 nuclei in the energy range\n20 to 500 MeV/nucleon. For particles below 80 MeV, this instrument acted as a\ndE/dx vs E detector. Above 80 MeV, it acted as a bidirectional triple dE/dx vs\nE detector. Flux directionality information was obtained by dividing certain\nportions of the data from each detector into eight angular sectors. For further\ndetails, see B. J. Teegarden et al., Astrophys. J., v. 202, p. 815, 1975.\n\nFor more information, see:\nhttp://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/imp8_GME/GME_home.html\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "OCTS is an optical radiometer devoted to the frequent global\nmeasurement of ocean color and sea surface temperature. OCTS will show\nthe amount of chlorophyll and dissolved substances in the water, and\ntemperature distribution. OCT's data will be used for determination of\nocean primary production and carbon cycle, and be used for getting the\ninformation of ocean conditions for fishery and environment monitoring\netc. OCTS is a successor to CZCS(Coastal Zone Color Scanner), the\nU.S. projects, which was the first real optical sensor for ocean\nobservation onboard NIMBUS-7 launched in 1978.\n\nOCTS has 8 bands in visible and near-infrared region and 4 bands in\nthermal region, and achieves highly sensitive spectral measurement\nwith these bands. The observation bands are determined on the\ncharacteristics of spectral reflectance of the object substances,\natmosheric windows and atmospheric correction. The spatial resolution\nis about 700m. This is applicable to the observation of coastal zone\nand land, the feature of these area baries quickly compared to the\nopen ocean. As the swathwidth is about 1400km on the ground, OCTS can\nobserve the same area every 3 days and can monitor rapidly changing\nphenomena. OCTS has optical calibration function using solar light and\nhalogen lamp as the calibration source. OCTS has two data trasmission\nmodes. All raw pixel data are transmitted through X band with fine\ndata transmission mode. One pixel data is sampled from every 6x6km\narea as typical data of the area and is transmitted at UHF band in\ncoarse data transmission mode.\n\nOCTS consists of scanning radiometer unit, which contains optical\nsystem and detector module, and-electrical unit. OCTS adopts catoptric\noptical system and mechanical rotating scanning method using\nmirror. this is because OCTS covers wide range of wavelength and wide\nscanning angles. OCTS can tilt its line of sight along the track to\nprevent the sunglitter at the sea surface from interrupting the\nobservation. For high sensitivity, each band has 10pixels aligned to\nthe track. The infrared detectors are cooled at 100k by a large\nrediant cooler facing the deep space.\n\nFor more information see:\n\"http://www.eorc.nasda.go.jp/ADEOS/Project/Octs.html\"\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: OCTS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Imaging Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Short_Name: OCTS\n      Long_Name: Ocean Color and Temperature Scanner\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: ADEOS-I\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "VIRS is one of the three instruments in the rain-measuring package on TRMM and provides a very indirect indicator of rainfall. It also ties TRMM measurements to other measurements that are made routinely using the meteorological Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (POESS) and those that are made using the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) operated by the United States. \n\nVIRS senses radiation coming from Earth in five spectral regions, ranging from visible to infrared, at wavelengths of 0.63 to 12 micrometers. VIRS is included in the primary instrument package on TRMM because of its ability to delineate rainfall, but even more importantly, because it serves as a transfer standard to other measurements that are made routinely using the POESS and GOES satellites. The intensity of the radiation in the various spectral regions (or bands) can be used to determine the reflectance (visible and near infrared) or brightness temperature (infrared) of the scene.\n\nIf the sky is clear, the temperature will correspond to that of the surface of Earth, and, if there are clouds, the temperature will tend to be that of the cloud tops. Colder temperatures will produce greater intensities in the shorter wavelength bands, and warmer temperatures will produce greater intensities in the longer wavelength bands. Since colder clouds occur at higher altitudes the measured temperatures are useful as indicators of cloud heights, and the highest clouds can be associated with the presence of rain. A variety of techniques use the infrared (IR) images from VIRS to estimate precipitation. Higher cloud tops are positively correlated with precipitation for convective clouds (generally thunderstorms), which dominate tropical (and therefore global) precipitation accumulations. One notable exception to this correlation is with the high cirrus clouds that generally flow out of thunderstorms. These cirrus clouds are high and therefore cold in the infrared observations, but they do not rain. To differentiate these cirrus clouds from water clouds (cumulonimbus), a technique, which involves comparing the two infrared channels at 10.8 and 12.0 micrometers, is employed. However, IR techniques usually have significant errors for instantaneous rainfall estimates. The strength of infrared observations lies in the ability to monitor the clouds continuously from Geostationary altitude. By comparing the visible and infrared observations from TRMM with the rainfall estimates of TMI and PR, scientists hope to learn much more about the relationship of the cloud tops as seen from Geostationary orbit. \n\nNASA Earth Science Reference Handbook [ Mission: TRMM ]\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: VIRS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Imaging Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Short_Name: VIRS\n      Long_Name: TRMM Visible Infrared Scanner\n   End_Group\n   Group: Instrument_Associated_Sensors\n      Short_Name: VIRS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: TRMM\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Spectral_Frequency_Resolution: 0.63 micrometers\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Infrared > Reflected\n      Spectral_Frequency_Resolution: 1.6 micrometers\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Infrared > Thermal\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 3.75 to 12 micrometers\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov/overview_dir/virs.html\n   Online_Resource: http://pmm.nasa.gov/TRMM/VIRS\n   Online_Resource: http://daac.gsfc.nasa.gov/precipitation/TRMM_README/TRMM_1B01_readme.shtml\n   Creation_Date: 2007-05-08\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Data_Rate: 49.8 Kbps (day), 28.8 Kbps (night)\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 1997-12-20\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "\nThe Charged Particle Analyzer (CPA) experiment consists of four\ndetectors including the LoE, HiE, LoP and HiP. Each will be\ndescribed in some detail. The reader is referred to Higbie, et\nal., 1978, or Baker, et al., 1985, for further instrument\ninformation.\n\nCPA experiments were flown on a series of LANL satellites\nbeginning in 1976. In all, 8 satellites were flown, the last was\nlaunched in 1987. After 1979 a constellation of at least three\nsatellites with CPA detectors were continuously maintained and\nthe data from some subset were processed up until\n1995. Currently two satellites remain operational, however, the\nCPA data from these is not processed due to processor\nlimitations and their function has been replaced with other LANL\nsatellites with SOPA detectors.\n\nThe LoE (low energy electron) subsystem is a set of five,\nsimilar, solid-state sensors (700 microns thick) in a fan\narrangement at angles of +/- 60, +/- 45 and 0 degrees to the\nnormal to the satellite spin axis (directed toward the\nEarth). Each telescope has a collimating aperture with a half\nangle of ~2.6 degrees, which provides a geometrical factor of\n3.096E-03 cm-sq sr. As the satellite spins, (period of ~10\nseconds), the telescopes sweep out parallel bands. During the\ncourse of a single rotation, the five LoE detectors record 200\nsamples of the unit sphere at each energy. There are six nested\nenergy channels with approximate lower thresholds of 30, 45,\n65, 95, 140, and 200 keV. Each channel has an upper threshold\nof 300 keV. Each of the five telescopes is fronted by an\naluminized Mylar sunscreen. The LoE telescopes do not\ndiscriminate between particle species, but rely instead on the\nnormal preponderance of electrons at GEO. Therefore, there is\nalways a small contaminatio n of each electron channel by\nprotons and other ions (usually less than 1%).\n\nThe HiE (high energy electron) subsystem is a single element,\ncollimated, solid-state sensor (3000 microns thick) mounted\nperpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis with a field-of-view\nhalf angle of 3.7 degrees and a geometrical factor of 1.407 E-02\ncm-sq sr. It is designed to monitor high-energy electrons. There\nare six nested energy channels with approximate lower thresholds\nof 200, 290, 430, 630, 930, and 1350 keV. Each channel has an\nupper threshold of 2000 keV. The HiE detector records 40 samples\nof the particle distribution each rotation. It is fronted by an\naluminized Mylar sunscreen. As with the LoE, the HiE depends on\nthe preponderance of electrons at GEO for species\ndiscrimination.\n\nThe LoP (low energy proton) subsystem is a single element,\ncollimated, solid-state sensor (85 microns thick) mounted\nperpendicular to the spacecraft spin axis with a field-of-view\nhalf angle of 2.8 degrees and a geometrical factor of 2.948E-03\ncm-sq sr. It is designed to monitor protons, and has 10 nested\nenergy channels with lower thresholds that vary from satellite\nto satellite, but which are about 80, 90, 110, 135, 175, 200,\n240, 300, 365, 455 keV and an upper threshold of ~580 keV. The\nLoP detector records 40 samples of the particle distribution\neach rotation. Electron contamination to the proton channels is\nminimized by the action of a sweeping magnet. An\nanti-coincidence scintillation discriminator vetoes particles\npenetrating the sensor. The LoP is fronted by a 90 micro-inch,\nnickel sunscreen.\n\nThe HiP (high energy proton) subsystem is a single, tri-element,\ncollimated, solid-state telescope (45 microns, 3300 microns,\nand 500 microns thick) mounted perpendicular to the spacecraft\nspin axis. Except for the collimated aperture, the stack of\nthree solid-state sensors is completely surrounded by a plastic\nanti-coincidence shield. The HiP detector has two slightly\ndifferent fields-of-view and geometrical factors, depending on\nwhich sensor element the particle is analyzed by field-of-view\nhalf angles of 6.5 and 6.7 degrees and geometrical factors of\n4.685 E-02 and 4.813 E-02 cm-sq sr. The HiP is designed to\nmonitor high-energy protons with 16 differential energy\nchannels. The channels differ slightly from satellite to\nsatellite due to slight variations in sensor dead-layers and in\nthe thickness of the front elements. However, the nominal\nenergy thresholds for the 16 channels are 0.4 MeV, 0.5, 0.6,\n0.8, 1.0, 1.3, 1.7, 2.8, 4.3, 8.0 14, 23, 33, 48, 71, and 100,\nwith an uppe r threshold of ~160 MeV. Like the LoP, the HiP\nrecords 40 samples of the particle distribution each\nrotation. Again, electron contamination to the proton channels\nis minimized by the action of a one kilogauss sweeping\nmagnet. The HiP collimator is fronted by an aluminized Mylar\nsunscreen.\n\n[Summary provided by Leadbelly.]\n\n"@en ;

Sound signals sent from the\nmoving ship bounce back to receivers aboard the ship. This\nprovides a profile of water movement relative to the\nship-precise modern navigation, allowing the ship's motion to be\nsubtracted from the data. These devices are also used on\nmoorings and profilers and, along with acoustic backscattering,\nmeasure animal biomass. Particles in the path of the sound\nwaves, mostly plankton, reflect a small part of the sound energy\nback toward receivers, allowing researchers to make remote\nestimates of the sizes and numbers of animals present in the\nwater column.  Before the 1970's, the most technologically\nadvanced instrument used to measure water velocity was known as\na Doppler speed log. This evolved into the first commercial\nADCP, produced in the mid-1970's, which used averaging. Later in\nthe 1970's, the first vessel-mounted ADCP was developed to\nmeasure water velocity more accurately and to allow measurement\nin range cells over a depth profile.\n\nAs instruments evolved, so did new techniques in Doppler signal\nprocessing. Initially, Doppler speed logs used simple analog\nsignal processing methods, which are still used in some\ncommercial speed logs today. However, the first ADCPs\nincorporated analog-to-digital signal conversion over a narrow\ncommunication bandwidth. Around 1990, this technique was\ndeveloped into broadband signal processing. Since then,\nbroadband ADCPs have been able to generate very accurate,\nreal-time velocity measurements.\n\nAdditional information available at\n\"http://www.whoi.edu/instruments/viewInstrument.do?id=819\"\n"@en ;

The objective of this experiment was to obtain vertical temperature, water vapor, and ozone profiles of the atmosphere to support Department of Defense resuirements in operational weather analysis and forecasting. The SSH was a 16-channel sensor with one channel (1022 cm-1) in the 10-micrometer ozone absorption band, one channel (835 cm-1) in the 12-micrometer atmospheric window, six channels (747, 725, 708, 695, 676, 668.5 cm-1) in the 15-micrometer CO2 absorption band, and eight channels (535, 408.5 441.5, 420, 374, 397.5, 355, 353.5 cm-1) in the 22- to 30-micrometer rotational water vapor absorption band. The experiment consisted of an optical system, detector and associated electronics, and a scanning mirror. The scanning mirror was stepped across the satellite subtrack, allowing the SSH to view 25 separate columns of the atmosphere every 32 s over a cross track ground swath of 2000 km. While the scanning mirror was stopped at a scene station, the channel filters were sequenced through the field of view. The surface resolution was approximately 39 km at nadir. Radiance data were transformed into temperature water vapor and ozone profiles by a mathematical inversion technique. A more complete description of the experiment can be found in the report, 'DMSP Block 5D Special Meteorological Sensor H, Optical Subsystem,' D. A.

        skos:definition  "\nThe Short Wave Infrared Radiometer (SWIR) is one of ASTER?s\nthree different subsystems.\n\nThe SWIR subsystem uses a single aspheric refracting\ntelescope. The detector in each of the six bands is a Platinum\nSilicide-Silicon (PtSi-Si) Schottky barrier linear array cooled\nto 80K.  Cooling is provided by a split Stirling cycle\ncryocooler with opposed compressors and an active balancer to\ncompensate for the expander displacer.  The on-orbit design life\nof this cooler is to be 50,000 hours.  Although ASTER will\noperate with a low duty cycle (8% average data collection time)\nthe cryocooler will operate continuously because the cool-down\nand stabilization time is long. No cyrocooler has yet\ndemonstrated this length of performance and the development of\nthis long-life cooler is one of several major technical\nchallenges facing the ASTER team.\n\nThe cryocooler is a major source of heat. Because the cooler is\nattached to the SWIR telescope, which must be free to move to\nprovide cross-track pointing, this heat cannot be removed using\na platform provided cold plate. This heat is transferred to a\nlocal radiator attached to the cooler compressor and radiated to\nspace.\n\nSix optical bandpass filters are used to provide spectral\nseparation. No prisms or dichroic elements are used for this\npurpose. A calibration device similar to that used for the VNIR\nsubsystem is used for in-flight calibration. The exception is\nthat the SWIR subsystem has only one such device.\n\nThe NE delta rho will vary from 0.5 to 1.3% across the bands\nfrom short to long wavelength. These performance estimates may\nbe optimistic for the bandpasses given in Table II. Since bands\n5-9 are narrower than those used in developing the conceptual\ndesign. The absolute radiometric accuracy is to be +4% or\nbetter. The combined data rate for all six SWIR bands, including\nsupplementary telemetry and engineering telemetry, is 23 Mbps.\n\nAdditional information is available at\n\"http://asterweb.jpl.nasa.gov/click/click.htm\"\n\n[Summary provided by NASA]\n\n\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "Ion microprobes have been around in various forms for many years. It was not\nuntil the mid 70's that the ion probe was viewed as having the potential to be\nthe geologist's ultimate weapon. The ion probe uses a focused beam of primary\nions to sputter away the sample surface. A small fraction of the sputtered\nmaterial is ionized and can then be accelerated into a mass spectrometer. A\ncharacteristic of secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) is a plethora of\natomic and molecular species which often cause isobaric interferences. The\nfirst ion microprobes relied on low mass resolution mass spectrometers and\ntried to strip away interferences by monitoring other peaks containing the\ninterfering elements. This method is fraught with difficulty because it relies\non the correct identification of all potential interferences. The first SIMS\ninstrument capable of high mass resolution was the Cameca ims-3f. This\ninstrument works as an ion microscope, that is, a direct image of the spatial\ndistribution of the isotopes in the target can be obtained. High mass resolving\npower could only be achieved on this instrument at the expense of beam\ntransmission - entrance and exit slits had to be very narrow thereby reducing\nthe amount of beam transmission.\n\n[Source: Stanford University.]\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "The Space Shuttle Discovery carrying UARS was launched on September \n12, 1991 from Kennedy Space Flight Center. UARS was released to orbit \non September 15, 1991, and the Improved Stratospheric and Mesospheric \nSounder (ISAMS) began scientific observations of the earth's upper \natmosphere September 26, 1991. \n\nISAMS is a limb-sounding radiometer which uses a combination of \npressure-modulated and wide-band infrared channels to measure Carbon \nMonoxide, Water Vapour, Nitrogen Dioxide, Nitric Acid, Ozone, Nitric \nOxide, Nitrous Oxide, Methane, Dinitrogen Pentoxide, Aerosol, and \nTemperature in the middle atmosphere. Typically, ISAMS produces \nvertical profiles of constituents and temperature every 200 km along \nthe tangent track, with an instantaneous field of view of about 2.4 km \nvertically. ISAMS made measurements, with several significant gaps, \nbetween 80 S and 80 N from 26 September 1991 to 29 July 1992. UARS is \nin a near sun-synchronous orbit so that while the 15 orbits/day are \nspaced approximately every 24 degrees of longitude around the equator, \nthe sampled local solar time actually changes by 20 minutes/day. \n\nThe ISAMS Primary Science Objectives: \n(1) To determine the thermal structure of the middle atmosphere and \nits fluctuations in space and time, \n(2) To investigate the photochemistry of nitrogen-containing species, \n(3) To study the water vapour budget, \n(4) To investigate the role of volcanic and polar stratospheric \naerosol in stratospheric chemistry. \n\nTypically, over 2600 temperature profiles/day were retrieved, spaced \nevery 200 km along the limb-viewing track and nominally extending from \n100-0.01 mb (15-80 km). \n\nISAMS Principal Investigator: Fred W.

        skos:definition  "Nansen bottles are 'water sampling bottles\" used by oceanographers to obtain\nsubsurface samples of seawater to determine the properties of sea-water.  These\nbottles are generally metal or plastic tubes with either plug valves at each\nend.  The bottle is lowered by wire with its valves open at both ends to the\ndesired depth. It is then closed in situ by allowing a weight (called a\nmessenger) to slide down the wire and strike the reversing mechanism. This\ncauses the bottle to turn upside down, closing the valves and reversing the\nreversing thermometers, which are mounted on the bottle in a special\nthermometer case. If, as is usually the case, a series of bottles are lowered,\nthen the reversal of each bottle releases another messenger to actuate the\nbottle beneath it.\n\nGenerally a number of bottles (12 to 24) are attached at predetermined\nintervals in series along the wire (a 'bottle cast') and closed in succession.\nWhen the bottles have been brought back to the deck the water samples are drawn\nthrough a tap, following a routine designed to obtain a pure sample.  In some\ndesigns, the bottle when tripped is released at its upper end and rotates\nthrough 180 degrees about a hinge at its lower end where it is clamped to the\nwire.  This is for the purpose of operating the 'reversing thermometers' and\nleads to the bottles being referred to as 'reversing bottles'.  In other\ndesigns, the bottle remains stationary while a frame carrying the reversing\nthermometers rotates.  A capacity of 1.25 liters is common for these bottles\nbut for special purposes, such as carbon-14 analysis, larger bottles are used -\nup to several hundred liters capacity.\n\nAnother arrangement of water bottles is in the form of a so- called 'rosette\nsampler'.  In this, 12 to 20 water bottles are mounted in a single frame which\nis attached to the end of the oceanographic wire.  This has an electrical\nconductor incorporated; the bottles can be closed when desired on electrical\ncommand from the deck.  This rosette arrangement is generally used in\nconjunction with a CTD sensor head with deck read-out so that water samples can\nbe obtained to check the CTD or to obtain confirmation of interesting features\nin the water profile.\n_________________________________________________________________\nTaken from:\nPickard, G.L, Descriptive Physical Oceanography, 3rd edition, Pergamon Press,\nOxford, 1979.

It increases the size of the waterway\nand provides construction materials for land-based projects. It\nalso improves logistics. The wider, deeper shipping channel\nprovides easier passage of vessels with deep draft. The deeper\nthe draft of a vessel, the more tonnage it can carry. If few\nships are available for logistics, then dredging can make these\nships more efficient.\n\nMaterial removed during dredging is often a naturally-occurring\nconstruction material. In military operations, natural materials\nmake up for scarce resources. Typically, sand is available along\nthe coast and in most rivers. Care must be taken to avoid clay\nor fine-grained sediments.\n\nTwo primary types of dredging occur: mechanical and hydraulic.\n\nMechanical equipment dredges easily with a clam shell, shovel,\nbackhoe, or other device that scoops the material up. A simple\ntype of mechanical dredge is a land crane, equipped with a\nsuitable bucket mounted on a barge. This dredge needs barges or\nscows to move the material from the dredging site to the\ndisposal site.\n\nThe hydraulic dredge uses water to remove and transport the\nmaterial. This system has a pump for moving the water. The pump\ncreates a vacuum or a pressure head, which moves water rapidly\nthrough the pipe. This system always has at least three\ncomponents: dredging device, pump, and discharge system. There\nare many common hydraulic dredging systems--hopper dredges,\nsidecast dredges, cutterhead dredges, and dustpan dredges.\n\n[Summary provided by the Globe Security Organization]\n\n\n\n"@en ;

Using a high intensity direct current discharge lamp,\nlight at 121.6nm (called Lyman-alpha light) photodissociates\nwater molecules producing excited OH radicals. Fluorescence is\nproduced as the OH radical emits photons at 309nm. Making use of\na phototube sensitive to this wavelength and a counter, the\namount of OH can be calculated. The ambient air in the sample\ndiminishes this signal by an amount proportional to the mixing\nratio, so knowing the ambient pressure and temperature yields\nthe mixing ratio from which the total water is determined. The\ninstrument is periodically calibrated in flight by injecting a\nknown amount of water vapor directly into the sample.\n\nAdditional information available at\n\"http://ghrc.msfc.nasa.gov/uso/readme/c4enlh.html\"\n\n\n\n"@en ;

In view of the project’s aim to demonstrate technology, several platform elements and systems have also been included as technology experiments.\n\nThe Proba-1 development approach includes several innovative aspects. A design-to-cost approach was adopted according to European Cooperation for Space Standardisation category 3 project classification. This involved using COTS (commercial off-the-shelf) equipment and units; simulation-based development, verification and testing; automated software generation; extensive use of test and operations infrastructure commonalities; and a highly integrated ESA-industry design and development team.\n\nExtensive use is made of automated functions onboard the spacecraft. Full onboard flight dynamics computation, in conjunction with automated ground segment functions such as pass automation and high-level user interfaces, satisfy the spacecraft autonomy requirements.\n\nAutomated functions onboard handle nominal spacecraft operations, plan and schedule activities, and manage payload resources. Onboard flight dynamics include orbital navigation as well as computation and control of instruments, camera pointing and scanning in order to meet user-defined targets (latitude, longitude and altitude).\n\nSummary provided by http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Proba_web_site/ESARBKTHN6D_0.html\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: HRC\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Photon/Optical Detectors\n      Instrument_Subtype: Cameras\n      Short_Name: HRC\n      Long_Name: High Resolution Camera\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: PROBA-1\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Proba_web_site/ESARBKTHN6D_0.html\n   Sample_Image: http://www.esa.int/images/Ardennes_M.jpg\n   Creation_Date: 2011-01-10\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

The measurements yield invaluable information on the intensity and distribution of the rain, the rain type, the storm depth and the height at which the snow melts into rain. The estimates of the heat released into the atmosphere at different heights based on these measurements can be used to improve models of the global atmospheric circulation. \n\n PR has a horizontal resolution at the ground of about 4 km and a swath width of 220 km. One of its most important features is its ability to provide vertical profiles of the rain and snow from the surface to a height of about 20 km. PR is able to detect fairly light rain rates down to about 0.7 mm/hr. For intense rain rates, where the attenuation effects can be strong, new methods of data processing have been developed that help correct for this effect. PR is able to separate out rain echoes for vertical sample sizes of about 250 m when looking straight down.  \n\nNASA Earth Science Reference Handbook [ Mission: TRMM ]\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: PR\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Active Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Profilers/Sounders\n      Instrument_Subtype: Radar Sounders\n      Short_Name: PR\n      Long_Name: TRMM Precipitation Radar\n   End_Group\n   Group: Instrument_Associated_Sensors\n      Short_Name: PR\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: TRMM\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Radio\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 13.8 GHz horizontal polarization; 220-km swath.\n      Spectral_Frequency_Resolution: 4.3 Km horizontal resolution instantaneous field-of-view (nadir), 0.25 km vertical resolution (nadir)\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/TRMM/channel/earth/index_e.htm\n   Online_Resource: http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/TRMM/channel/instruments/index_e.htm\n   Online_Resource: http://trmm.gsfc.nasa.gov/overview_dir/pr.html\n   Online_Resource: http://pmm.nasa.gov/TRMM/PR\n   Sample_Image: http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/TRMM/channel/instruments/pr/image/pr2.jpg\n   Creation_Date: 2007-05-08\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Data_Rate: 93.2 Kbps\n      Instrument_Owner: JAPAN/JAXA\n      Instrument_Owner: Communications Research Laboratory - Japan\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

The ATM has demonstrated this accuracy at distances as\ngreat as a thousand kilometers from any base station.\n\nThe current ATM instruments (ATM2 and ATM3) and their predecessors\nhave a history going back to the mid 1970&#039;s. The instruments commonly\nfly aboard the NASA P3-B based at Wallops Flight Facility,\nVirginia. ATM2 has also flown aboard several twin-otter (DH-6)\naircraft. A major task of the ATM over recent years has been the\nmeasurement of the Greenland ice sheet with the goal of determining\nchanges in the ice sheet elevation. Other uses have included\nverification of satellite altimeters , and the measurement of sea-ice\nthickness. The altimeter often flies in conjunction with other\ninstruments, and has been used to measure sea-surface elevation and\nocean wave characteristics.\n\nNew applications are always being investigated. Measurement of coastal\nbeach dynamics and monitoring of beach erosion was begun in 1995 with\nan initial airborne survey of northern Assateague Island in\nconjunction with the National Park Service&#039;s ground-based monitoring\neffort.

It may be deployed from the surface by hand or\nvehicle, in boreholes, between boreholes, from aircraft and from\nsatellites.  It has the highest resolution of any geophysical\nmethod for imaging the subsurface, with centimeter scale\nresolution sometimes possible.\n\nResolution is controlled by wavelength of the propagating\nelectromagnetic wave in the ground.  Resolution increases with\nincreasing frequency (shorter wavelength).  Depth of\ninvestigation varies from less than one meter in mineralogical\nclay soils like montmorillonite to more than 5,400 meters in\npolar ice.  Depth of investigation increases with decreasing\nfrequency but with decreasing resolution.  Typical depths of\ninvestigation in fresh-water saturated, clay-free sands are\nabout 30 meters.  Depths of investigation (and resolution) are\ncontrolled by electrical properties through conduction losses,\ndielectric relaxation in water, electrochemical reactions at\nthe mineralogical clay-water interface, scattering losses, and\n(rarely) magnetic relaxation losses in iron bearing minerals.\nScattering losses are the result of spatial scales of\nheterogeneity approaching the size of the wavelength in the\nground (like the difference between an ice cube and a snowball\nin scattering visib le light).  Detectability of objects in the\nground depends upon their size, shape, and orientation relative\nto the antenna, contrast with the host medium, as well as\nradiofrequency noise and interferences.\n\nAdditional information available at\n\"http://www.g-p-r.com/\"\n\n[Summary provided by Gary R.

        skos:definition  "[Text Source: CNES, http://spot4.cnes.fr/spot4_gb/hrvir.htm ]\n\nThe HRVIR imaging instrument is designed to acquire, instantaneously, one complete line of pixels at a time covering the entire field of view. This is achieved using charged-couple device (CCD) linear array.\n\nSpecial optical devices forming a so-called \"spectral separator\" separate the in-coming light (from target area on the ground) into four spectral channels.\n\nThe CCD linear arrays operate in the so-called \"push-broom\" mode. A wide-angle telescope forms an instantaneous image of adjacent \"ground patch areas\" on a row of detectors in the instrument's focal plane.\n\nColumn-wise scanning is a direct result of the satellite's motion along its orbit. The signals generated by the detectors (photodiodes) are read out sequentially at a predetermined clock rate. Thus, although the linear arrays do not \"scan\" in the line-wise direction to gather light, the detectors are scanned electronically to generate the output signal.\n\nThe telescope has a field of view of 4°, corresponding to 60 km on the ground covered instantaneously by a line of 6000 detectors. Each HRVIR is thus said to offer a \"strip width\" of 60 km.\n\nAs just mentioned, each detector generates one pixel at a time, each pixel corresponding to a ground patch area measuring 10 metres square in the high-resolution mode. When adjacent detectors are electronically scanned in pairs, they yield pixels corresponding to a ground patch area measuring 20 metres square resulting in imagery with 20-m resolution. The satellite's motion along its orbit results in successive scanlines, hence complete images.\n\nThe HRVIR instrument has two operating modes, depending on whether the detectors are read out singly or in pairs. The image quality is very high, partly because no moving parts are involved in image generation.\n\nThe light entering the HRVIR is sunlight reflected by the Earth's surface then gathered by a telescope with a focal length of 1.08 m and an aperture of ƒ/3.5. The in-coming beam is split into four spectral channels by a beam-splitter consisting of prisms and filters, then focused onto four rows of detectors. As just mentioned, four rows of detectors simultaneously generate four lines of \"registered\" pixels; in other words a single line of landscape is simultaneously observed in four perfectly registered spectral bands.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: HRVIR\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Imaging Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Short_Name: HRVIR\n      Long_Name: High Resolution Visible and Infrared\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: SPOT-4\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.50 µm - 0.59 µm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.61 µm - 0.68 µm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Near Infrared\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.79 µm - 0.89 µm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Near Infrared\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 1.53 µm - 1.75 µm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.61 µm - 0.68 µm\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://spot4.cnes.fr/spot4_gb/hrvir.htm\n   Online_Resource: http://www.wmo.ch/pages/prog/sat/Instruments_and_missions/HRVIR.html\n   Online_Resource: http://www.crisp.nus.edu.sg/~research/tutorial/spot.htm\n   Sample_Image: http://spot4.cnes.fr/spot4_gb/images/hrv/hrvir1.jpg\n   Creation_Date: 2008-08-20\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: France/CNES\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "[Source: NASA LDCM Homepage, http://ldcm.nasa.gov/spacecraft_instruments/tirs.html ]\n\nThe Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) will measure land surface temperature in two thermal bands with a new technology that applies quantum physics to detect heat. \n\nTIRS was added to the satellite mission when it became clear that state water resource managers rely on the highly accurate measurements of Earth's thermal energy obtained by LDCM's predecessors, Landsat 5 and Landsat 7, to track how land and water are being used. With nearly 80 percent of the fresh water in the Western U.S. being used to irrigate crops, TIRS will become an invaluable tool for managing water consumption.\n\nTIRS uses Quantum Well Infrared Photodetectors (QWIPs) to detect long wavelengths of light emitted by the Earth whose intensity depends on surface temperature. These wavelengths, called thermal infrared, are well beyond the range of human vision. QWIPs are a new, lower-cost alternative to conventional infrared technology and were developed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.\n\nThe QWIPs TIRS uses are sensitive to two thermal infrared wavelength bands, helping it separate the temperature of the Earth's surface from that of the atmosphere. Their design operates on the complex principles of quantum mechanics. Gallium arsenide semiconductor chips trap electrons in an energy state 'well' until the electrons are elevated to a higher state by thermal infrared light of a certain wavelength. The elevated electrons create an electrical signal that can be read out and recorded to create a digital image.\n\nMore Information: http://ldcm.nasa.gov/spacecraft_instruments/tirs.html\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: TIRS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Imaging Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Short_Name: TIRS\n      Long_Name: Thermal Infrared Sensor\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: LANDSAT-8\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Infrared > Thermal\n      Number_Channels: 1\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 10.6-11.2 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Infrared > Thermal\n      Number_Channels: 1\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 11.5-12.5 μm\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://ldcm.nasa.gov/spacecraft_instruments/tirs.html\n   Sample_Image: http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/566479main_ldcm-TIRS2.jpg\n   Creation_Date: 2013-02-07\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NOAA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "1. Introduction\n\nThe Two dimensional optical array probes (2D-OAP), models 2D-C\nand 2D-P, are instruments developed by Particle Measuring\nSystems (PMS Inc., Boulder, Co) for the measurement of cloud and\nprecipitation drop size distributions. These sensors are used\nprimarily for the study of cloud microphysical processes,\nparticularly the growth of cloud drops and ice crystals through\naggregation, riming and coalescence into drizzle, rain drops,\ngraupel or other forms of precipitation.\n\n2. Operating Principles\n\nThe 2Ds record the two dimensional shadows of hydrometeors as\nthey pass through a focussed He-Ne laser beam (Fig. 1). The\nshadow is cast onto a linear diode array and the on/off state of\nthese diodes is stored during the particle's passage through the\nlaser beam. This informatio, along with the time that has passed\nsince the previous particle, is sent to the data system and\nrecorded for post-flight analysis.\n\nInformation about a particle's shape and size is deduced from\nanalysis of the recorded shadow with a variety of pattern\nrecognition algorithms. Figure 2 illustrates some measurements\nby the 2D probe in several different types of clouds, ranging\nfrom rain drops to pristine ice crystals to more complex heavily\nrimed ice particles. Figure 3 is a photograph of the 2D-C in the\ncanister that is normally mounted on an aircraft pylon. A\ncomplement of 2Ds is normally flown during a project to cover\nthe size range of interest. The 2D cloud probe (2D-C) measures\nin the range from 25 mm to 800 mm and the 2D precipitation probe\n(2D-P) measures in the large size range from 200 mm to 6400 mm.\n\nAdditional information available at\n\"http://raf.atd.ucar.edu/Bulletins/B24/2dProbes.html\"\n\n[Summary provided by UCAR]\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "Many modern radio clocks use the Global Positioning System to provide more accurate time than can be obtained from these terrestrial radio stations. These GPS clocks  combine time estimates from multiple satellite atomic clocks with error estimates maintained by a network of ground stations. Due to effects inherent in radio propagation and ionospheric spread and delay, GPS timing requires averaging of these phenomena over several periods. No GPS receiver directly computes time or frequency, rather they use GPS to discipline an oscillator that may range from a quartz crystal in a low-end navigation receiver, through oven-controlled crystal oscillators (OXCO) in specialized units, to atomic oscillators (rubidium) in some receivers used for synchronization in telecommunications. For this reason, these devices are technically referred to as GPS-disciplined oscillators.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: GPS CLOCKS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Positioning/Navigation\n      Instrument_Subtype: GPS\n      Short_Name: GPS CLOCKS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Instrument_Associated_Sensors\n      Short_Name: GPS\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: GPS\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www.kema.com/Default.aspx\n   Creation_Date: 2010-08-31\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

It provides day and night imaging of land, water and clouds, measures sea surface temperature, ice, snow and vegetation cover.\n\nThe AVHRR/3 is a six-channel imaging radiometer that detects energy in the visible and infrared (IR) portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. The instrument measures reflected solar (visible and near-IR) energy and radiated thermal energy from land, sea, clouds, and the intervening atmosphere. The instrument has an instantaneous field-of-view (IFOV) of 1.3 milliradians providing a nominal spatial resolution of 1.1 km (0.69 mi) at nadir. A continuously rotating elliptical scan mirror provides the cross-track scan, scanning the Earth from ± 55.4° from nadir. The mirror scans at six revolutions per second to provide continuous coverage.\n\nThe instrument provides spectral and gain improvements to the solar visible channels that provide low light energy detection. Channel 3A, at 1.6 microns, provides snow, ice, and cloud discrimination. Channel 3A will be time-shared with the 3.7-micron channel, designated 3B, to provide five channels of continuous data. An external sun shield and an internal baffle have been added to reduce sunlight impingement into the instrument’s optical cavity and detectors. \n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: AVHRR-3\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Imaging Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Short_Name: AVHRR-3\n      Long_Name: Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer-3\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: METOP\n      Short_Name: METOP-A\n      Short_Name: METOP-B\n      Short_Name: NOAA-19\n      Short_Name: NOAA-18\n      Short_Name: NOAA-17\n      Short_Name: NOAA-16\n      Short_Name: NOAA-15\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Near Infrared\n      Number_Channels: 3\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.58 μm - 1.64 μm\n      Spectral_Frequency_Resolution: 1.09 km\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Infrared > Thermal\n      Number_Channels: 3\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 3.55 μm - 12.5 μm\n      Spectral_Frequency_Resolution: 1.09 km\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www2.ncdc.noaa.gov/docs/klm/html/c3/sec3-1.htm\n   Online_Resource: http://www.esa.int/esaLP/SEM9VEG23IE_LPmetop_0.html\n   Online_Resource: http://www.eumetsat.int/Home/Main/Satellites/Metop/Instruments/SP_2010053153142514\n   Online_Resource: http://database.eohandbook.com/database/instrumentsummary.aspx?instrumentID=403\n   Sample_Image: http://goespoes.gsfc.nasa.gov/poes/instruments/images/enlarged_avhhr.jpg\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-22\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NOAA\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

The instrument consisted of four detectors mounted beneath hemispherical domes of different thicknesses. Each detector was a pin-diffused junction silicon diode. The dosimeter directly measured the ionization in the silicon cube caused by natural radiation and served as an electron-proton spectrometer, thus yielding the integral fluxes of energetic electrons and protons encountered in the orbit as a function of time. The energy thresholds for measured electrons by different dome sensors were 1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 MeV, and those for protons were 20, 35, 51, and 75 MeV. The radiation dose and the energetic electron flux obtained in this experiment may result in an optimization of space radiation-shielding design to protect sensitive electronics components.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: SPACE RADIATION DOSIMETER\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Thermal/Radiation Detectors\n      Short_Name: SPACE RADIATION DOSIMETER\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: DMSP 5D-2/F7\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1983-113A-07\n   Creation_Date: 2008-09-29\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: Department of Defense-Department of the Air Force (United States)\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

The GOMOS instrument\nwill monitor the global ozone in the 250-950 nm window by comparing\nmeasurements with the spectrum of stars outside and through the\natmosphere. The GOMOS instrument also will measure H2O, NO2, ClO, NO3,\nBrO, OClO, temperature, and aerosols. The GOMOS instrument consists of two\nbore-sighted telescopes, each with its own spectrometer. The GOMOS optical\nsystem consists of a Cassegrain telescope which simultaneously filtered\nradiation through a 0.6 nm resolution U-Vis spectrometer for measurements\nin the Huggins and Chappuis bands (0.25-0.45 micrometer and 0.425-0.65\nmicrometer) and through a near-IR high-resolution 0.07 nm spectrometer for\noxygen (O2) and water vapor (H2O) measurements in the 0.758-0.772\nmicrometer and 0.926-0.943 micrometer range. A CCD-based star tracker,\nwhich operates in either dark limb or bright limb mode, shares the same\nfocal plane and provides pointing and tracking accuracy required to\nmaintain the star image at the center of the spectrometers entrance slits.\nStellar occulatations give a vertical resolution of 1.7 km. There were\nabout 25 occultations per orbit or about 350 observations during a single\n24 hour period. Two blocks of CCD lines, above and below the stellar\nspectrum, allows measurement of the atmospheric background which is\nsubtracted out of the stellar spectrum. The GOMOS instrument measures\natmospheric transmission in the stratosphere from 15-20 km altitude up to\n60 km from the UV (250 nm) to near-IR (950 nm) with a spatial resolution\nof 0.6 nm.  Transmission is measured along the tangential line-of-sight\nfrom the spacecraft to stars. The stellar spectrum is measured outside the\natmosphere and compared with the spectrum measured through the atmosphere.\nThe full UV-vis-Near-IR spectrum is recorded continuously in multispecral\nmode. Atmospheric chemical species, such as ozone, are characterized by\nthe attenuation of the stellar spectrum and tangential column densities\nare derived from a comparison of unattenuated stellar spectra with the\nsame instrument a few seconds before. Absolute concentrations of\natmospherc species are insulated from instrumental drifts using this\nfull-spectrum method and ensures long-term stability of the ozone\ndistribution.\n\nFor more information see:\nGOMOS Home Page:\n\"http://auc.dfd.dlr.de/info/AUC/GOMOS/\"\n\nGOMOS Home Page at Finnish Meteorological Instituteinish:\n\"http://sumppu.fmi.fi/~kyrola/gomos.html\"\n\nFor more information on ENVISAT, see:\n\"http://envisat.esa.int/\"\n\n"@en ;

A similar instrument (AMSR) was flown on the JAXA ADEOS-II spacecraft in December 2002.\n\nAMSR-E monitors various atmospheric and surface water processes that influence weather and climate. It provides improved measurements of rain rates and greatly extends the spatial coverage of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite, while also measuring water vapor, sea surface winds, sea surface temperature, sea ice, soil moisture, snow cover, and the amount of water in clouds.\n\nThe AMSR-E is a 14-channel, 8-frequency passive microwave radiometer which measures microwave radiation from the Earth's surface and atmosphere. Frequencies of the AMSR-E are 6.9, 10.7, 18.7, 23.8, 36.5, and 89.0 (horizontal and vertical polarization), and 50.3 and 52.8 GHz (vertical polarization only).

        skos:definition  "[Text Source: NSSDC, \nhttp://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1986-019A-01 ]\n\nThe SPOT-A High Resolution Visible (HRV) imager provides acquisition of high-resolution data of the earth's surface on a global basis. It consists of two identical high-resolution visible (HRV) imaging instruments and a package comprising two magnetic-tape data recorders and a telemetry transmitter. The HRV experiment is designed to operate in either or both of two modes, in the visible and near infrared spectral regions: (1) a panchromatic (black and white) mode corresponding to observation over a broad spectral band (0.51 0.73 micrometer) and (2) a multispectral (color) mode corresponding to observation in three narrower spectral bands (0.50 - 0.59, 0.61 0.68, and 0.79 - 0.89 micrometer). The instrument's sampling mesh corresponds to a ground element (pixel) that is 10 m x 10 m in the first case and 20 m x 20 m in the second, for nadir viewing. The two detectors are of the CCD (charge-coupled device) type. Each array consists of 6000 detectors without any mechanical scanning. Light from the scene being viewed enters the HRV instrument via a plane mirror that is steerable by ground control. The viewing axis can thus be oriented as required in the plane perpendicular to the orbit. This off-nadir viewing capability covers a range of plus or minus 27 deg relative to the vertical (in 45 steps of 0.6 deg each). This allows the instrument to image any point within a strip extending 475 km to either side of the satellite ground track. The width of the swath actually observed varies between 60 km for nadir viewing and 80 km for extreme off-nadir viewing. With this special feature of off-nadir viewing, the two HRV instruments can be pointed to cover adjacent fields in order to obtain complete earth coverage. Among other possibilities introduced by this feature are increased revisit coverage at intervals ranging from one to several days and the recording of stereoscopic pairs of images of a given area during successive satellite passes. The observation sequence is loaded every day into the onboard computer by the Toulouse ground-control station while the satellite is within its range. The operation sequences for the two HRV instruments are entirely independent. Data will be processed at the Centre de Rectification des Images Spatiales (CRIS) which will be jointly set up by the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES) and the Institut Geographique National (IGN). CRIS is responsible for archiving SPOT-A raw data received at Toulouse and for carrying out image data processing.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: HRV\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Imaging Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Short_Name: HRV\n      Long_Name: High Resolution Visible Imaging System\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: SPOT-4\n      Short_Name: SPOT-3\n      Short_Name: SPOT-2\n      Short_Name: SPOT-1\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.50 µm - 0.59 µm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.61 µm - 0.68 µm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Near Infrared\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.79 µm - 0.89 µm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.51 µm - 0.73 µm\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1986-019A-01\n   Online_Resource: http://earth.esa.int/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=4074\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: France/CNES\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

A pitot-static system generally consists of a pitot tube, a static port, and the pitot-static instruments.  This equipment is used to measure the forces acting on a vehicle as a function of the temperature, density, pressure and viscosity of the fluid in which it is operating.  Other instruments that might be connected are air data computers, flight data recorders, altitude encoders, cabin pressurization controllers, and various airspeed switches. Errors in pitot-static system readings can be extremely dangerous as the information obtained from the pitot static system, such as altitude, is often critical to a successful flight. Several commercial airline disasters have been traced to a failure of the pitot-static system. \n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: PITOT-STATIC SYSTEM\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: In Situ/Laboratory Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Pressure/Height Meters\n      Short_Name: PITOT-STATIC SYSTEM\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: DC-8\n      Short_Name: AIRCRAFT\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitot-static_system\n   Creation_Date: 2011-05-23\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

Its images will have 15-meter (49 ft.) panchromatic and 30-meter multi-spectral spatial resolutions along a 185 km (115 miles) wide swath, covering wide areas of the Earth's landscape while providing sufficient resolution to distinguish features like urban centers, farms, forests and other land uses. The entire Earth will fall within view once every 16 days due to LDCM's near-polar orbit. \n\nOLI's design is an advancement in Landsat sensor technology and uses an approach demonstrated by the Advanced Land Imager sensor flown on NASA's experimental EO-1 satellite. Instruments on earlier Landsat satellites employed scan mirrors to sweep the instrument fields of view across the surface swath width and transmit light to a few detectors. The OLI will instead use long detector arrays, with over 7,000 detectors per spectral band, aligned across its focal plane to view across the swath. This \"push-broom\" design results in a more sensitive instrument providing improved land surface information with fewer moving parts. With an improved signal-to-noise ratio compared to past Landsat instruments, engineers expect this new OLI design to be more reliable and to provide improved performance. \n\nMore Information: http://ldcm.nasa.gov/spacecraft_instruments/oli.html\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: OLI\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Imaging Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Short_Name: OLI\n      Long_Name: Operational Land Imager\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: LANDSAT-8\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Number_Channels: 1\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.433–0.453 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Number_Channels: 1\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.450–0.515 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Number_Channels: 1\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.525–0.600 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Number_Channels: 1\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.630–0.680 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Near Infrared\n      Number_Channels: 1\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.845–0.885 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Infrared > Reflected\n      Number_Channels: 1\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 1.560–1.660 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Infrared > Reflected\n      Number_Channels: 1\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 2.100–2.300 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Number_Channels: 1\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.500–0.680 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Near Infrared\n      Number_Channels: 1\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 1.360–1.390 μm\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://ldcm.nasa.gov/spacecraft_instruments/oli.html\n   Sample_Image: http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/566477main_ldcm-oli_s2.jpg\n   Creation_Date: 2013-02-07\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/USGS\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

ILAS-II is a spectrometer which\nobserves the atmospheric limb absorption spectrum from the upper\ntroposphere to the stratosphere using sunlight as a light source\n(solar occultation technique).\n\nThe spectrometer covers the infrared region (2-13fÊm) and the near\nvisible region (753 to 784nm).

ILAS's observations are focused in the\nhigh latitude regions because of the geometrical relation of the solar\noccultation events with the sun-synchronous orbit. From these spectral\nobservations, ILAS-II can measure the vertical profiles of species\nrelated to ozone hole phenomena:ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide(NO2),\naerosols, water vapor (H2O), CFC11, methane(CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O),\nchlorine nitrate (CIO NO2),temperature, and pressure.\n\nCharacteristics:\n\n      * Spectral Coverage\n           CH:1 : 7.14 - 11.76mm(1400 - 850cm - 1)\n           CH:2 : 2 - 8mm(5000 - 1250cm - 1)\n           CH:3 : 12.80 - 12.83mm(781 - 779cm - 1)\n           CH:4 : 753 - 784nm\n      * Spatial Coverage(Height)\n           10 - 60km\n      * Vertical Resolution\n           1km\n      * Observation Accuracy\n           5%(1% to ozone)\n              (Processing Error is not included)\n      * Observation Region\n           N56 - 70deg / S63 - 88deg\n      * Spectrometer\n           CH:1 : Grating Spectrometer\n           CH:2 : Prism Spectrometer\n           CH:3 : Grating Spectrometer\n           CH:4 : Concave Grating Spectrometer\n      * Observation Parameters\n           O3,HNO3,N2O,H2O,CFC-11,CFC-12 CIONO2, Aerosols,Pressure and\n           Temperature.\n\nAdopted from the Earth Observation Satellite Homepage:\n\"http://www.eoc.nasda.go.jp/guide/satellite/sendata/ilas2_e.html\"\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "The primary purpose of the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR) experiment was (1) to provide all-weather measurements of ocean surface temperature and wind speed, and (2) to obtain integrated liquid water column content and atmospheric water vapor column content for path length and attenuation corrections to the ALT and SASS observations. Microwave brightness temperatures were observed with a 10-channel (five-frequency dual polarized) scanning radiometer operating at 0.8-, 1.4-, 1.7-, 2.8-, and 4.6-cm wavelengths (37, 21, 18, 10.7, and 6.6 GHz). The antenna was a parabolic reflector offset from nadir by 0.73 rad. Motion of the antenna reflector provided observations from within a conical volume along the ground track of the spacecraft. The SMMR had a swath width of about 600 km and the spatial resolution ranged from about 22 km at 37 GHz to about 100 km at 6.6 GHz. The absolute accuracy of sea surface temperature obtained was 2 K deg with a relative accuracy of 0.5 K deg. The accuracy of the wind speed measurements was 2 m/s for winds ranging from 7 to about 50 m/s. The same experiment was flown on Nimbus 7. A more detailed description can be found in E. Njoku, et al., \"The Seasat Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR): instrument description and performance,\" IEEE J. Oceanic Eng., v. OE-5, pp. 100-115, 1980. The instrument operated continuously in orbit from July 6, 1978 for a period of 95 days, until the spacecraft failed on October 10, 1978.

        skos:definition  "The High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS/3) is a discrete stepping, line-scan instrument designed to measure scene radiance in 20 spectral bands to permit the calculation of the vertical temperature profile from Earth's surface to about 40 km.\n\nMultispectral data from one visible channel (0.69 micrometers), seven shortwave channels (3.7 to 4.6 micrometers) and twelve longwave channels (6.5 to 15 micrometers) are obtained from a single telescope and a rotating filter wheel containing twenty individual filters. An elliptical scan mirror provides cross-track scanning of 56 increments of 1.8 degrees. The mirror steps rapidly (<35 msec), then holds at each position while the 20 filter segments are sampled. This action takes place each 100 msec. The instantaneous FOV for each channel is approximately 1.4 degrees in the visible and shortwave IR and 1.3 degrees in the longwave IR band which, from an altitude of 833 kilometers, encompasses an area of 20.3 kilometers and 18.9 kilometers in diameter, respectively, at nadir on the Earth.\n\nThree detectors are used to sense the radiation. A silicon photodiode at the instrument temperature (nominally 15 degrees C) detects the visible energy. An Indium Antimonide detector and a Mercury Cadmium Telluride detector (mounted on a passive radiator and operating at 100K) sense the shortwave and longwave IR energy. The shortwave and visible optical paths have a common field stop, while the longwave path has an identical but separate field stop. Registration of the fields of view in all channels is largely determined by these stops with secondary effects from detector position.\n\nIR Calibration of the HIRS/3 is provided by programmed views of two radiometric targets: a warm target mounted to the instrument base and a view of space. Data from these views provides sensitivity calibrations for each channel every 40 lines (256 seconds), if commanded. Internally generated electronic signals provide calibration and stability monitoring of the amplifier and readout electronics.\n\nData from the instrument is multiplexed into a single data stream controlled by the TIP system of the spacecraft. Information from the radiometric channels and voltage telemetry are converted to 13-bit binary data. Radiometric information is processed to produce the maximum dynamic range such that instrument and digitizing noises are a small portion of the signal output. Each channel is characterized by a noise equivalent radiance (NEΔN) and a set of calibration data that may be used to derive atmospheric temperatures and probable errors.\n\nThe HIRS/3 instrument is a single package mounted on the Instrument Mounting Platform (IMP) of the NOAA KLM spacecraft.\n\nInformation obtained from http://www2.ncdc.noaa.gov/docs/klm/html/c3/sec32-1.htm\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: HIRS/3\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Profilers/Sounders\n      Short_Name: HIRS/3\n      Long_Name: High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder/3\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: NOAA-16\n      Short_Name: NOAA-15\n      Short_Name: NOAA-14\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Near Infrared\n      Number_Channels: 19\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 6.5 to 15 micrometers & 3.7 to 4.6 micrometers\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Number_Channels: 1\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.69 micrometers\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www2.ncdc.noaa.gov/docs/klm/html/c3/sec32-1.htm\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-21\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: NOAA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

The Nimbus 3 HRIR was a modified version of previous experiments on Nimbus 1 and 2. It used a dual band-pass filter which transmitted reflected solar radiation in the 0.7- to 1.3-micrometer band as well as emitted thermal radiation in the 3.4- to 4.2-micrometer band. By detecting reflected solar radiation in the 0.7- to 1.3-micrometer band, the radiometer could also map the earth's cloud cover during the daytime. Radiant energy from the earth was collected by a flat scanning mirror inclined at 45 deg to the optical axis. The mirror rotated at 48 rpm and scanned in a plane normal to the spacecraft velocity. The radiation reflected from the scan mirror was chopped at the focus of a 10.2-cm f/1 modified Cassegrain telescope. The modulated energy was then refocused on a lead selenide detector cell that transformed the received radiation into an electrical output. The output was amplified and recorded on magnetic tape for subsequent playback to a ground acquisition station. Using the direct readout infrared radiometer (DRIR) system, nighttime and daytime data could be transmitted by the real-time transmission system (RTTS) to ground APT stations. A ground resolution of 8.5 km could be obtained at nadir. The HRIR measured radiance temperatures between 210 and 330 deg K to a general accuracy of 1 deg K. For a more detailed description, see Section 3 of \"The Nimbus III User's Guide\" (TRF B03409). The experiment was successful until August 1969, when noise in the tape recorder system gradually reduced the quality of the data. Routine processing of HRIR data was terminated after January 31, 1970. All experiment operations ceased on January 22, 1972, when the spacecraft was deactivated. The HRIR world montages were presented in \"The Nimbus III Data Catalog\" (TRF B06523), available from NSSDC.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: HRIR NIMBUS-3\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Radiometers\n      Short_Name: HRIR NIMBUS-3\n      Long_Name: High-Resolution Infrared Radiometer on NIMBUS-3\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: NIMBUS-3\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Infrared > Thermal\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 3.4 μm - 4.2 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Infrared > Reflected\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.7 μm - 1.3 μm\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1964-052A-03\n   Online_Resource: http://atmospheres.gsfc.nasa.gov/nimbus/\n   Online_Resource: http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/nimbus\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "\nThe system designed to monitor sea level consists of a\ncombination of a bottom pressure sensor (the tide gauge itself)\nand a surface barometer. The combined use of these two pressure\nmeasurements, altogether with the knowledge of the density\nprofile of the water column above the tide gauge, allows to\ninfer the water level above the bottom pressure sensor. It will\nbe shown that for shallow waters, the accuracy will mainly\ndepend on the accuracy of the pressure sensors.\n\nThe used bottom pressure gauge is a WLR7 Aanderaa, which has a\nquartz crystal sensor whose oscillating frequency is a function\nof the absolute pressure exerted on it. The range of frequency\nvariations of the sensor determines the range of depths where\nthe instrument may be used.  Since the bottom pressure sensor\nmeasures not only the pressure exerted by the water column\nabove, but also the atmospheric pressure, the later must be\nmeasured and conveniently subtracted.  The barometer used to\nmeasure the atmospheric pressure is an Aanderaa 2810 model\ngiving the pressure difference between the two sides of a thin\nmembrane that is exposed to the atmospheric pressure on one side\nand to a reference vacuum on the other.  Finally, the tide gauge\nalso has temperature and conductivity sensors. The first is\nincluded in all models, since temperature is required to\ncalibrate the pressure measurements. Instead, the conductivity\ncell is attached as an optional sensor.  Pressure measurements\nare finally transformed into water level by using the well-known\nhydrostatic relationship g P h r = (1)\n\nWhere h is the height above the pressure sensor, P is the\npressure difference measured by the gauge sensor and he\nbarometer, g is the gravity acceleration and r is the density of\nthe water column above the pressure sensor. In this simplified\nversion of the hydrostatic equation density is assumed as\nconstant along the water column above the instrument, a\nreasonable assumption for a few meters depths. The time\nvariation of density is obtained by using the values of\ntemperature and conductivity provided by the WRL7 sensors.  The\ncomplementary approach regarding density measurements would be\nto obtain periodical CTD profiles at the instrument site. In\nthat case, the water column would not be taken as constant with\nheight, but the time variations would have to be interpolated in\nbetween the CTD measurements. This approach would be more\nappropriate for gauges deployed at open sea, at depths of the\norder of tens of meters.\n\n[Summary provided by the Institut Mediterrani d' Estudis Avancats]\n\n\n\n\n\n"@en ;

The DPR consists of a Ku-band precipitation radar (KuPR) and a Ka-band precipitation radar (KaPR). The KuPR (13.6 GHz) is an updated version of the highly successful unit flown on the TRMM mission. The KuPR and the KaPR will be co-aligned on the GPM spacecraft bus such that that the 5 km (3.1 mile) footprint location on the earth will be the same.\n\nThe DPR is a spaceborne precipitation radar capable of making accurate rainfall measurements. The DPR is expected to be more sensitive than its TRMM predecessor especially in the measurement of light rainfall and snowfall in the high latitude regions. Rain/snow determination is expected to be accomplished by using the differential attenuation between the Ku-band and the Ka-band frequencies. The variable pulse repetition frequency (VPRF) technique is also expected to increase the number of samples at each IFOV to realize a 0.2 mm/h sensitivity.\n\nInformation provided by http://pmm.nasa.gov/GPM/flight-project/DPR.

Because of a range-change circuit failure occurring in early July 1975,\nthe experiment was commanded into a fixed +/-36 nT range on July 11, 1975 at\n12:55:09 UT and has been in that range ever since. The measurements are A-to-D\nconverted onboard, to an 8-bit resolution, yielding +/-0.14 nT quantization\nsensitivity, which is larger than the intrinsic sensor noise level of 0.025 nT\nRMS.\nThe data from the two-bit (per component) adaptive delta modulator,\nincorporated into the instrument, and applied to the intrinsic sample rate of\n25 vectors/sec., was never utilized, and hence the rate of the full (8-bit)\nvector words, which occur every 320 ms, represents the effective sample period\nof the instrument.

        skos:definition  "The SeaWinds scatterometer is a specialized microwave radar that measures near-surface wind velocity (both speed and direction) under all weather and cloud conditions over Earth's oceans. The experiment is a follow-on mission and continues the data series initiated in 1996 by the NASA scatterometer (NSCAT).  The SeaWinds instrument was launched on the NASA QuikScat \"quick recovery\" satellite on June 19, 1999.  SeaWinds was also launched on the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Advanced Earth Observation Satellite II (ADEOS-II) on December 14, 2002. ADEOS-II failed on October 24, 2003.\n\nSeaWinds uses a rotating dish antenna with two spot beams that sweep in a circular pattern. The antenna radiates microwave pulses at a frequency of 13.4 gigahertz across broad regions on Earth's surface. The instrument will collect data over ocean, land, and ice in a continuous, 1,800-kilometer-wide band, making approximately 400,000 measurements and covering 90% of Earth's surface in one day.\n\nScatterometers use a highly indirect technique to measure wind velocity over the ocean. Changes in the wind velocity cause changes in ocean surface roughness, modifying the radar cross section of the ocean and the magnitude of the backscattered power. Multiple collocated measurements acquired from several viewing geometries (incidence angles, polarizations, and directions) are used to determine wind speed and direction simultaneously. The directly measured backscatter cross-sections over land and ice-covered regions yield information on vegetation type and ice type and extent.\n\nKey SeaWinds Facts\nHeritage: SeaSat, NSCAT\nDimensions: CDS: 32 cm ? 46 cm ? 34 cm; SES: 81 cm ? 91 cm ? 43 cm;\nSAS: ~150 cm; 100-cm diameter antenna dish on 60-cm diameter ? 60-cm pedestal\nMass: 220 kg\nPower: 220 W\nDuty Cycle: 100%\nThermal Control: Radiators\nThermal Operating Range: 5\\u201340Ú C\nField of View (FOV): Rotating (at 18 rpm) pencil-beam antenna with dual feeds pointing 40Ú and 46Ú from nadir\nIFOV: ? 51Ú from nadir\nSwath: 1800 km (? 51Ú look angles) from 803-km altitude\nPointing Requirements (3Ã): Control: <0.3Ú (~1000 arcsec); Knowledge: <0.05Ú (~167 arcsec); Stability: <0.008Ú/s (30 arcsec/s)\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: SEAWINDS\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Active Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Scatterometers\n      Short_Name: SEAWINDS\n      Long_Name: SeaWinds\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: QUIKSCAT\n      Short_Name: ADEOS-II\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Microwave\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 13.4 gigahertz; 110-watt pulse at 189-hertz pulse repetition frequency (PRF)\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://winds.jpl.nasa.gov/\n   Online_Resource: http://winds.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/quikscat/index.cfm\n   Online_Resource: http://winds.jpl.nasa.gov/missions/seawinds/index.cfm\n   Online_Resource: http://nasascience.nasa.gov/missions/seawinds\n   Sample_Image: http://winds.jpl.nasa.gov/images/QuikSCAT_high.jpg\n   Creation_Date: 2007-04-16\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Data_Rate: 40 kbps\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 1999-07-19\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Data_Rate: 40 kbps\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 2003-04-10\n      Instrument_Stop_Date: 2003-10-24\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "\nThe Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric Sounding (MIPAS) is a\ncore European Space Agency (ESA) instrument on the ENVISAT spacecraft\n(launched March 1, 2002). MIPAS is a high-resolution Fourier-transform\nspectrometer designed to measure the concentration profiles of atmospheric\nconstituents on a global scale. MIPAS will observe the atmospheric\nemissions from the Earth horizon (limb) throughout the mid-infrared\nregion, which will allow the simultaneous measurement of more than 20\ntrace gases, including the complete family of nitrogen-oxygen compounds\nand several CFCs.  MIPAS will provide global data coverage, including the\npolar regions. The instrument measures atmospheric radiation in the\nspectral-coverage range 4.15 um to 14.6 um. This covers almost the\ncomplete mid-infrared region, and thus the emission lines of many\natmospheric species are captured.\n\nIn order to determine the concentration profiles of the atmospheric trace\ngases, MIPAS will measure a series of spectra from different tangent\nheights. A basic elevation scan sequence will comprise 16 high resolution\nspectra or up to 75 spectra with a reduced spectral resolution. A typical\nelevation scan will start at about 50 km tangent height and descend in 3\nkm steps to 5 km. It will also be possible to code different elevation\nscan sequences within the tangent height range in variable step sizes.\n\nMeasurements are possible in either of two pointing regimes. One pointing\nregime is rearwards in the anti-flight direction within a 35 ! wide range\nused for good earth coverage and the polar regions. The second pointing\nregime is sideways within a 30 ! wide range on the anti-Sun side. This\nviewing direction is provided for the observation of volcanic eruptions,\nair-traffic corridors, or concentration gradients across the dusk/dawn\nterminator.\n\nThe MIPAS instrument uses eight detectors. The spectral range is split\ninto five bands, where each band is covered by one or two specific\ndetector pairs (A, B1, B2, C and D). In a typical data collection orbit,\n16 scene measurements will be recorded in sequence for different\natmospheric elevations, followed by two deep space measurements. This\ntakes approximately 80 seconds and repeats for the duration of measurement\nin the orbit. This gives 75 scans per orbit. One spectrum consists of\n35000 samples and takes four seconds. One altitude scan requires 16\nspectra measurements and one deep space offset measurement. The altitude\nscan lasts about 75 seconds. The spectrum is converted in a single\ninterferogram and would be appriximately 62 Kbytes.\n\nFor more information on MIPAS see:\n\"http://auc.dfd.dlr.de/info/AUC/MIPAS/\"\n\nFor more information on ENVISAT, see:\n\"http://envisat.esa.int/\"\n\n"@en ;

Data for heat balance of the earth-atmosphere system were obtained, as well as measurements of water vapor distribution, surface or near-surface temperatures, and seasonal changes of stratospheric temperature distribution. The five wavelength regions were (1) the 6.4- to 6.9-micrometer channel, which covered the 6.7-micrometer water vapor absorption band, (2) the 10- to 11-micrometer band, which operated in the \"atmospheric window,\" (3) the 14- to 16-micrometer band, which covered the 15-micrometer carbon dioxide absorption band, (4) the 5- to 30-micrometer band, which measured the emitted long-wavelength infrared energy for heat budget purposes, and (5) the 0.2- to 4.0-micrometer channel, which yielded information on the intensity of reflected solar energy (albedo). Radiant energy from the earth was collected by a flat scanning mirror inclined at 45 deg to the optical axis. The mirror rotated at 8 rpm and scanned in a plane perpendicular to the direction of motion of the satellite. Each of the five channels contained a 4.33-cm-diameter folded telescope with a 2.8-deg field of view and a thermistor-bolometer. The collected energy was modulated by a mechanical chopper to produce an ac signal. The signal was then amplified and recorded on magnetic tape for subsequent playback to a ground acquisition station. At a satellite altitude of 1100 km, a horizontal resolution of 55 km could be obtained. The MRIR experiment was successful, and good data were obtained from launch until the recorder failed on July 29, 1966.

        skos:definition  "\nGermanium Semiconductor Detector (GSD) are semiconductor diodes\nhaving a P-I-N structure in which the Intrinsic (I) region is\nsensitive to ionizing radiation, particularly X-rays and gamma\nrays. Under reverse bias, an electric field extends across the\nintrinsic or depleted region. When photons interact with the\nmaterial within the depleted volume of a detector, charge\ncarriers (holes and electrons) are produced and are swept by the\nelectric field to the P and N electrodes. This charge, which is\nin proportion to the energy deposited in the detector by the\nincoming photon, is converted into a voltage pulse by an\nintegral charge sensitive preamplifier.\n\nBecause germanium has a relatively low band gap, these detectors\nmust be cooled in order to reduce the thermal generation of\ncharge carriers (thus reverse leakage current) to an acceptable\nlevel. Otherwise, leakage current induced noise destroys the\nenergy resolution of the detector. Liquid nitrogen, which has a\ntemperature of 77?K is the common cooling medium for such\ndetectors. The detector is mounted in a vacuum chamber which is\nattached to or inserted into an LN2 dewar or an electrically\npowered cooler. The sensitive detector surfaces are thus\nprotected from moisture and condensable contaminants.\n\n[Source: CANBERRA \"http://www.canberra.com\"]\n\n\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "SEPICA is one of nine instruments aboard the ACE spacecraft. Its mission is to\ncollect information about particles emanating from the Sun. SEPICA detects the\nionic charge state, kinetic energy, and nuclear charge of ions coming from the\nSun, and with that information, one can determine not only the type of ions\npresent, but also the history of those ions within the Sun. This aids\nscientists in their understanding of the Sun and the processes that take place\nwithin it. \n\nThe SEPICA instrument is the prime sensor on ACE, which is used to determine\nthe\ncharge state distribution of energetic particle distributions. SEPICA is\ndesigned to measure the ionic charge state, Q, the kinetic energy, E, and the\nnuclear charge, Z, of energetic ions above 0.2 MeV/Nuc (Stone et al., 1990).\nThis includes ions accelerated in solar flares as well as in interplanetary\nspace during energetic storm particle (ESP) and co-rotating interaction region\n(CIR) events. For low mass numbers SEPICA will also separate isotopes -- for\nexample, 3He and 4He. During solar quiet times, SEPICA should also be able to\ndirectly measure the charge states of anomalous cosmic ray nuclei, including H,\nN, O, and Ne, which are presumed to be singly-charged. With the capability to\ndifferentiate the charge states of ions, the instrument will also be able to\nseparate neutral atoms (Q = 0) from ions. Thus it may be able to identify\nenergetic neutrals created through charge exchange.\n\nThe instrument is based on the design of the ULEZEQ (Ultra Low Energy Z E Q\nAnalyzer) sensor flown on the ISEE spacecraft (Hovestadt et al., 1978). The\nsensor combines the determination of the electrostatic deflection of incoming\nions in a collimator-analyzer assembly by the measurement of the impact\nposition in the detector plane and a dE/dx - E telescope with a proportional\ncounter solid state detector combination. The background from penetrating\nradiation is suppressed by the use of an anti-coincidence detector. The\nscientific objectives of the ACE mission call for significant improvements over\nthe ULEZEQ sensor in the following parameters of the instrument:\n\n1. Increase of the geometrical factor by at least a factor of 10 (to improve\nthe measurement statistics significantly)\n\n2. Improvement of the charge resolution to deltaQ/Q 0.1 below 0.7 MeV/nucleon\n(to allow resolution of individual charge states for elements up to oxygen.\n\nSEPICA was built as a collaboration between the UNH Space Science Group and the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). SEPICA's mission was\nproposed in 1986. The project was kicked off into Phase B in May of 1991, with\nthe development and implementation of Phase C started in January, 1994.\nSatellite integration and testing (Phase D) was carried out through 1996 and\n1997. ACE itself was launched on 25 August, 1997, on a Delta II launch vehicle,\nfrom the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Since then, SEPICA has been returning\ndata on the solar wind.\n\nSee:\nhttp://www-ssg.sr.unh.edu/tof/Missions/Ace/index.html?acemain.html\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: SEPICA\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Solar/Space Observing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Particle Detectors\n      Short_Name: SEPICA\n      Long_Name: Solar Energetic Particle Charge Analyzer\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: ACE\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www.ssg.sr.unh.edu/tof/Missions/Ace/index.html?sepicamain.html\n   Sample_Image: http://helios.gsfc.nasa.gov/ace/sepica_sm.tif\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Data_Rate: 0.604 kbps\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 1997-08-25\n      Instrument_Owner: University of New Hampshire, Space Science Group\n      Instrument_Owner: NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

AVNIR has 4 spectral bands with a 16m spatial resolution and 1 panchromatic band with an 8 m spatial resolution. The AVNIR data will be useful for environmental awareness and monitoring of such phenomena as desertification, destruction of tropical forests, and pollution of coastal zones as well as for resource exploration, land use, etc.\n\nAVNIR's field of view (FOV) is about 80km, picked up by lines of small pixels. Its FOV scans the entire earth's surface as the satellite moves. There are only a few other similar sensors, such as TM on LANDSAT. Among AVNIR's sensors are features which give the sensors high spatial resolution, a pointing function to change the observation field by +-40 degrees along the cross track, a 0.4rim band useful for coastal zones and lakes, an optical calibration function which uses solar light and lamps, as well as others.\n\nAVNIR is composed of two units, the Scanning Radiometer Unit (SRU) which is mainly composed of optical components and the Electronic Unit (ELU) which includes mainly electronic components. Optics in SRU adopts a Catadioptric Schmidt optical system to reduce aberration in a wide field of view. Large mirrors used in Optics and Pointing Mechanism Assembly are ultralight mirrors weighing 50 to 70% less than conventional mirrors, made from low expansion material. CFRP with low thermal and moisture expansion properties is used as the truss structural material in order to make Optics light yet extremely precise in orbit. The large linear-array CCDs with 5,000 and 10,000 pixels are used as detectors and deliver high spatial resolution. Observation data is compressed in the Image Processing Assembly by about 10% in order to reduce the transmission data rate. \n\n[Summary provided by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency.]\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: AVNIR\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Imaging Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Short_Name: AVNIR\n      Long_Name: Advanced Visible and Near-Infrared Radiometer\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: ADEOS-I\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.42 μm - 0.50 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.52 μm - 0.60 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Visible\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.61 μm - 0.69 μm\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Near Infrared\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 0.76 μm - 0.89 μm\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/en/hatoyama/satellite/sendata/avnir_e.html\n   Sample_Image: http://www.eorc.jaxa.jp/hatoyama/satellite/sendata/image/avnir_pic.gif\n   Creation_Date: 2008-08-20\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Start_Date: 1996-08-17\n      Instrument_Owner: Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

HALOE uses solar occultation to measure simultaneous vertical profiles of Ozone (O3), Hydrogen Chloride (HCl), Hydrogen Fluoride (HF), Methane (CH4), Water Vapor(H2O), Nitric Oxide (NO), Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Temperature, Aerosol Extinction at 4 infrared wavelengths, Aerosol composition and size distribution versus atmospheric pressure with a 1.6 km instantaneous field of view at the Earth's limb. \n\nAimed at better understanding the coupled chemistry, dynamics, and energetics of the Earth's middle and upper atmosphere, HALOE was selected to fly on UARS supported by the NASA Mission to Planet Earth program. HALOE is a collaboration among the Langley Research Center; Max Planck Institute for Chemistry; University of Chicago; University of Michigan; University of California, Irvine; NOAA/Environmental Research Laboratory; and Imperial College, U. K. Fabricated and calibrated in-house by engineers at NASA Langley Research Center, the over 14 years of flawless operation of HALOE is an icon of their dedication and commitment to quality. \n\nDr. James M.

        skos:definition  "The Cloud's and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) is a 3-channel radiometer measuring reflected solar radiation in the 0.3-5 µm wavelength band, emitted terrestrial radiation in the 8-12 µm band, and total radiation from 0.3 µm to beyond 100 µm. These data are being used to measure the Earth's total thermal radiation budget, and, in combination with MODIS data, detailed information about clouds. The first CERES instrument was launched on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite in November 1997 as CERES-PFM; the second and third CERES instuments were launched on the Terra satellite in December 1999 as CERES-FM1 AND -FM2; and the fourth and fifth CERES instruments are on board the Aqua satellite, as CERES-FM3 and CERES-FM4.\n\nCERES consists of two broadband scanning radiometers that measure the Earth's radiation balance and provide cloud property estimates to assess their role in radiative fluxes from the surface to the top of the atmosphere.\n\nCERES is a broadband scanning thermistor bolometer package with extremely high radiometric measurement precision and accuracy. The Terra spacecraft carries two identical instruments: one operates in a cross-track scan mode and the other in a biaxial scan mode. The CERES Terra cross-track scanning data greatly extends the CERES data from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) to achieve complete global measurements by adding mid-latitude and polar observations. TRMM data is restricted by its orbit to roughly cover 40S to 40N. Terra crosstrack data also adds observations at different times of day than TRMM (and later Aqua) in order to increase the accuracy of measuring the large diurnal cycle of the radiation fields from day to night. Finally, the CERES Terra biaxial scan mode provides new observations of the angular radiation fields in order to greatly improve the accuracy of the final fluxes of solar and thermal energy used to derive the Earth's radiation balance.\n\nEach CERES instrument has three channels - a short-wave channel for measuring reflected sunlight, a longwave channel for measuring Earth-emitted thermal radiation in the 8-12 µm \"window\" region, and a total channel for total radiation. Onboard calibration hardware includes a solar diffuser, a tungsten lamp system with a stability monitor, and a pair of blackbody sources. Cold space and internal calibration looks are performed during each normal Earth scan.\n\nCERES is a Principal Investigator instrument provided by NASA and managed by NASA's Langley Research Center (LaRC) in Hampton, Virginia. The instrument was built by TRW in Redondo Beach, California. The CERES Team Leader is Norman Loeb.\n\nInformation obtained from http://asd-www.larc.nasa.gov/ceres/terra/\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: CERES-PFM\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Radiometers\n      Short_Name: CERES-PFM\n      Long_Name: Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System - Prototype Flight Model\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: TRMM\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://asd-www.larc.nasa.gov/ceres/terra/\n   Online_Resource: http://ceres.larc.nasa.gov/\n   Online_Resource: http://pmm.nasa.gov/TRMM/CERES\n   Sample_Image: http://asd-www.larc.nasa.gov/ceres/trmm/ceres_instrument.gif\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-25\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

The CVI has also been used on the ground for these studies.  At the CVI inlet tip, cloud droplets or ice crystals larger than about 8 µm aerodynamic diameter are separated from the interstitial aerosol and impacted into dry nitrogen gas.  This separation is possible via a counterflow stream of nitrogen out the CVI tip, which assures that only larger particles (cloud droplets or ice crystals) are sampled.  Because droplets or crystals in a sampling volume of about 200 l/min are impacted into a sample stream of approximately 10 l/min, concentrations within the CVI are significantly enhanced.    The water vapor and non-volatile residual nuclei remaining after droplet evaporation are sampled downstream of the inlet with selected instruments.  These may include a Lyman-alpha or similar hygrometer, a condensation nucleus counter, an optical particle counter, filters for chemical analyses, or user instruments.\n\nReferences\n\nNoone, K.J., Ogren, J.A., Heintzenberg, J., Charlson, R.J. and D.S.

The AVCS sensors consisted of three vidicon cameras mounted on the satellite sensory ring, facing earthward and deployed in a fan-like array to produce a three-segment composite picture. Each camera covered a 35-deg field of view with the center camera pointing straight down. The optical axes of the other two cameras were directed 35 deg to either side. Each of the cameras employed an f/4 lens with a focal length of 18.2 mm. A potentiometer attached to the solar array controlled the lens opening from f/16 when the spacecraft was over the equator to f/4 when it was near the poles. The 800-scan-line, 2.54-cm vidicon pickup tubes yielded a linear resolution of better than 1 km at nadir from an approximate altitude of 1100 km. At this altitude, the camera array could produce a composite picture covering an area of 720 by 3400 km. Successive frames were taken at 91-s intervals providing about 20% overlap in coverage. A 40-ms exposure time was used, and the image was scanned by the electron beam in 6.5 s. The resulting signal was frequency modulated and recorded on three tracks of a magnetic tape, one track for each camera. Sufficient tape was provided for recording 53 pictures (about 1-2/3 orbits of data). The AVCS data were multiplexed with the High-Resolution Infrared Radiometer (HRIR) data and, using a transmission frequency of 1707.5 MHz, were telemetered to a ground station in 4 min. The experiment operated normally until August 31, 1966, when the tape recorder malfunctioned. Sporadic operation was continued until September 2, 1966, when the recorder failed completely, terminating data acquisition except for direct readouts received over North Carolina and Alaska readout stations. The experiment was successful in providing high-quality cloudcover pictures over an entire season on a near-global basis and in confirming the reliability of the camera system for use in future operational weather satellites. Data from this experiment can be obtained through SDSD.

The camera used a 108-deg wide-angle f/1.8 objective lens with a focal length of 6.0 mm. The camera was mounted facing earthward on the H-frame inside the sensory ring, with its optical axis parallel to the spacecraft spin axis. The actual photography required 8 s and the transmission 200 s. Earth-cloud images retained on the photosensitive surface of the 2.54-cm-diameter vidicon were read out at four lines per second to produce an 800-line picture. A 5-W TV transmitter (137.5 MHz) relayed the pictures to local APT stations within communication range. The faceplate of the vidicon had reticle marks that appeared on the picture format to aid in relating the picture to its geographical position on the earth's surface. From the satellite attitude and altitude (approximately 1100 km), a picture covered a 1200- by 1200-km square with a horizontal resolution of better than 3 km at nadir. The APT system was capable of transmitting the nighttime high-resolution infrared radiometer (HRIR) sensor output through the APT transmitter. Hence, with some minor modifications, an APT station within telemetry range could receive HRIR data in the direct readout infrared radiometer (DRIR) mode.

The separation distances\nbetween the pair of sensors are variable and as great as 160 m tip-to-tip. One\noperating mode involves length ratios of the two antennas of about 2:1 in order\nto verify instrument operation through showing that the electric field\nsignature is proportional to the boom length.

The instrument detects the radiation in a frequency\nrange between 604.3 and 662.3 GHz. This corresponds to\nwavelengths of about 0.45-0.5 mm. In this frequency range a\nmajor part of the radiation is absorbed by atmospheric water\nvapor. As most of the water vapor is found in the troposphere\n(in the Arctic up to 8 km, in the tropics up to 16 km altitude)\nthe instrument is operated on board of an aircraft flying at an\naltitude of 10-12 km, such that a major part of the water vapor\nabsorption is avoided.\n\nThe ASUR instrument in its current configuration can measure\nemission lines of the trace gases HCl, ozone, ClO, N2O, HNO3,\nCH3Cl, H2O, BrO, HO2, HCN, and NO. The horizontal resolution of\nthe measurements ranges between 12 and 50 km and depends on\nsignal intensity and aircraft speed. The maximum time of\ncontinuous operation is 10-11 hours and is determined by the\nstorage volume of liquid cryogen (see section Setup).\n\nThe hardware of the ASUR instrument [Whyborn et al., 1996, Mees\net al., 1995] has been developed and built in a collaboration\nbetween SRON (Space Research Organisation of the Netherlands),\nGroningen and the Institute of Environmental Physics of the\nUniversity of Bremen. The spectrometers AOS (Acousto-Optical\nSpectrometer) and CTS (Chirp-Transform Spectrometer) were\ndeveloped , in the framework of an ESA/ESTEC project by the\nObservatoire de Meudon, Paris, and the Deutsche Aerospace (now:\nASTRIUM), respectively.\n\nAdditional information available at\n\"http://www.iup.physik.uni-bremen.de/asur/general/instrument_e.html\"\n\n\n"@en ;

It produces analog voltage responses\nto scene radiance in 8 spectral bands. Voltages from thermistors\nattached to the instrument chopper and detectors are recorded to\nprovide a means of compensating for thermal effects on sensor\nresponse and for calculation of target surface temperatures. The\n8 bands are approximately 0.45 '-' 0.52,0.52 0.60, 0.63-0.69,\n0.76-0.90, 1.15-1.30, 1.55-1.75, 2.08-2.35, 10.4-12.5 um. Bands\n1-4 have silicon detectors and bands 5-7 have lead sulfide\ndetectors. The MMR's dimensions are 26.4 cm by 20.5 cm by 22.2\ncm and the device weighs 6.4 kg. The MMR is battery\npowered. Data logging was via a microprocessor-based Omnidata\nPolycorder where analog to digital conversions take place.\n\nThe NASA Bell UH-1B helicopter optical remote sensing system\nsupported a data acquisition system consisting of a bore-sighted\nMMR; a color video camera; and two 35 mm flight research cameras\nloaded with color film (one with a 1 inch focal length and the\nother with a 6 inch focal length). Controller units for all the\noptical devices are rack-mounted inside the helicopter and are\nwired such that a single switch closure triggers all\ndevices. The switch closure also activates an audible tone which\nis recorded on one of the two audio tracks of a Beta-format\nvideo recording system. The other audio track of the VCR was\nused to record cabin intercom conversations among the helicopter\ncrew. If one desires to examine site conditions in greater\ndetail, the higher resolution 35 mm still photography can be\nreviewed.\n\nAdditional information available at\n\"http://forest.gsfc.nasa.gov/html/fedmac/helo/helo_mmr.html\"\n\n[Summary provided by NASA]\n\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "FTIR SPECTROMETER - Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer\n\nTraditional (dispersive) infrared techniques experience\ndifficulties due to the '1 wavenumber at a time' nature of data\nacquisition. This leads to either a poor signal to noise ratio\nin a spectrum or a very long time needed to obtain a high\nquality spectrum. Both these situations cause problems with\nkinetic work. The first gives inherent large errors, the second\nprohibits in-situ work. These problems can be overcome using\nFourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) that is based on\nthe interferometer originally designed by Michelson and a\nmathematical procedure developed by Fourier that converts\nresponse from the 'time' to the 'frequency' domain.\n\nIn the Michelson interferometer a parallel, polychromatic beam\nof radiation from a source (A) is directed to a beam splitter\n(B), made from an infrared transparent material, such as\nKBr. The beam splitter reflects approximately half of the light\nto a mirror, known as the fixed mirror (C), which in turn\nreflects the light back to the beam splitter. The rest of the\nlight passes through to a mirror, moving continuously, at a\nknown velocity, back and forth along the direction of the\nincoming light and this is known as the moving mirror (D). Upon\nreflection from the moving mirror, radiation is then directed\nback to the beam splitter. At the beam splitter some of the\nlight that has been reflected from the fixed mirror combines\nwith light reflected from the moving mirror and is directed\ntowards the sample. After passing through the sample (E) the\nradiation is focused onto the detector (F). The detectors are\nsufficiently fast to cope with time domain signal changes from\nthe modulatio n in the interferometer.\n\nAdditional information available at\nhttp://physics.nist.gov/Divisions/Div842/Gp1/fts_intro.html\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "The Secchi (rhymes with etch-e) disk originated with Fr. Pietro Angelo\nSecchi, an astrophysicist, who was requested to measure transparency\nin the Mediterranean Sea by Commander Cialdi, head of the Papal Navy. Secchi\nwas the scientific advisor to the Pope. Secchi used some white disks\nto measure the clarity of water in the Mediterranean in April of l865. Various\nsizes of disks have been used since that time, but the most frequently\nused disk is an 8 inch diameter metal disk painted in alternate black and white\nquadrants.\n\nThe Secchi disk is used to measure how deep a person can see into the\nwater. It is lowered into a body of water until the observer loses\nsight of it. The disk is then raised until it reappears. The depth of\nthe water where the disk vanishes and reappears is the Secchi disk\nreading.\n\nEven though the Secchi disc measurement of water clarity is an\napproximate evaluation of the transparency of water, it is used\nprimarily for its simplicity. A more accurate measurement of\nunderwater irradiance can be made by the use of photometer.\n\nA Secchi Disk measures water clarity. Water clarity may be affected by\nthree different factors -- algae, sediment and / or water color.\nOne of the major reasons why Secchi disc measurements decrease from\nspring to fall, is due to the increase of plankton-- both\nphytoplankton and zooplankton. Since zooplankton graze on\nphytoplankton, (algae i.e.), the Secchi disc readings may increase\nduring the summer by the reduction of algae in\nthe water. Algae blooms may occur when the amount of available\nnutrients increases faster than the macrophytes (plants rooted in the\nbottom of a lake)can absorb them.\n\nThis summary has been adapted from the MSLA page on\n\"THE SECCHI DISK - WHAT IS IT?\"\n\nAdditional information on Secchi Disk available at\n\"http://www.pollardwater.com/emarket/pages/L0921002disks.asp\"\n\n\n"@en ;

The electrons pass on their excited state to the hydrogen nuclei, altering their spin state populations, and polarizing the liquid, just like in a standard proton magnetometer but with much less power and to greater extent.\n\nActually, the total magnetization vector of the hydrogen liquid is larger in an Overhauser magnetometer, which allows sensitivity to be improved as well. Also, since the liquid can be polarized while the signal is being measured, Overhauser magnetometers have a much higher speed of cycling and sensitivity than standard proton precession magnetometers.\n\nOverhauser magnetometers are without question the most energy efficient magnetometers available with sensitivities suitable for Earth field measurement. Power consumption can be optimized to be as low as 1W for continuous operation, yielding sensitivities between 0.1nT to 0.01nT, and sampling rates as high as 5Hz. Also, no warm up time is required, so for slow reading rates, the sensor can be shut down to save power. Continuous Overhauser magnetometers, like the GSM-19 or GSM-11, operate with continuous polarization, and offer sampling rates up to 10Hz, but require more power (few watts) to operate.\n\nInformation obtained from http://www.gemsys.ca/index.htm\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: OVM\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Magnetic Field/Electric Field Instruments\n      Short_Name: OVM\n      Long_Name: Overhauser Scalar Magnetometer\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://www.gemsys.ca/index.htm\n   Creation_Date: 2008-07-18\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "\nRadar is an acronym for \"radio detection and ranging.\" A radar\nsystem usually operates in the ultra-high-frequency (UHF) or\nmicrowave part of the radio-frequency (RF) spectrum, and is used\nto detect the position and/or movement of objects. Radar can\ntrack storm systems, because precipitation reflects\nelectromagnetic fields at certain frequencies. Radar can also\nrender precise maps. Radar systems are widely used in\nair-traffic control, aircraft navigation, and marine navigation.\n\nHigh-power radar, using large dish antennas, has been used to\nmeasure distances to the moon, other planets, asteroids, and\nartificial satellites. From unmanned space probes, radar has\nbeen used to map Venus, whose surface is obscured at visible\nwavelengths by a thick layer of clouds. Radar has been employed\nby NASA (the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration)\nto make highly detailed topographical maps of the earth's\nsurface as well.\n\nMost radar systems determine position in two dimensions: azimuth\n(compass bearing) and radius (distance). The display is in polar\ncoordinates. A rotating antenna transmits RF pulses at defined\nintervals. The delay between a transmitted pulse and the echo,\nor return pulse, determines the radial position of the plotted\npoint(s) for each azimuth direction on the display. The greater\nthe echo delay from a particular object in space, the farther\nfrom the display center its point appears. The maximum range of\na UHF or microwave radar system depends on the height of the\nantenna above average terrain, the topography of the surface in\nthe region, the atmospheric conditions in the region, and in\nsome cases the level of radio background noise.\n\nRadar is known to the general public for its use by law\nenforcement in determining the speeds of motor vehicles. This\ntype of radar does not display the exact position of an object,\nbut determines its radial speed vector from the Doppler\neffect. A radar detector, which consists of a simple\nUHF/microwave broadband receiver, can be used in a car or truck\nto warn drivers of the presence of police radar. Radar detectors\nare illegal in some states.\n\nThe Weather Service uses so-called Doppler radar to determine\nnot only the positions and extent of storm systems, but wind\npatterns and velocities aloft. Doppler radar employs a\ncombination of position-sensing and speed-sensing radar, making\nit possible to ascertain the locations and intensity of severe\nthunderstorms, hurricanes, and tornadoes.\n\nRadar has been used on the high-frequency (HF) radio bands,\nbetween approximately 5 MHz and 20 MHz, in an attempt to obtain\nearly warning in the event of a nuclear assault via ballistic\nmissiles. The ionosphere refracts HF waves, allowing much\ngreater system range than is possible with radar at UHF or\nmicrowave frequencies. During the 1970s and early 1980s, the\nsignals from these systems became infamous because of the\ninterference they caused. Radio amateurs coined the term\nwoodpecker to describe the sound of HF over-the-horizon radar\npulses in communications receivers.\n\n[Source: Tech Target]\n"@en ;

The wavelengths of primary interest were at 1356 and 3371 A. Energetic photoelectrons were provided by photoionization of neutral molecules by solar EUV radiation. As these fast photoelectrons lost energy through collisions with neutrals, those with energies near 16 eV excited O and N2 to electronic states of energy higher than the ground states. The subsequent decay to the ground state produced emissions monitored by the SSD. The SSD measured light emitted by molecular nitrogen excitation in the LBH and 2D position bands, and atomic oxygen in the 1356 and 1304 lines. The instrument also had the capability of providing spectral scans from 850 to 1200, from 1100 to 1600, and from 2900 to 3950 A at 4, 6, and 12 A resolution, respectively. Light monitored with narrow collimators that provided a field-of-view of 0.1 deg x 4 deg. The SSD was mechanically driven to scan vertically through the earth's limb from 80 to 480 km. It provided approximately 50 sets of density profiles on the daylight portion of each orbit.\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: SSD\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Solar/Space Observing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Ultraviolet Instruments\n      Short_Name: SSD\n      Long_Name: Atmospheric Density Sensor\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: DMSP 5D-1/F4\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1979-050A-07\n   Creation_Date: 2008-09-25\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: Department of Defense-Department of the Air Force (United States)\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;

        skos:definition  "The Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) instrument is a multi-channel, conical- scanning, microwave radiometer serving an essential role in the near-global-coverage and frequent-revisit-time requirements of GPM. \n\nThe instrumentation enables the Core spacecraft to serve as both a 'precipitation standard' and as a 'radiometric standard' for the other GPM constellation members. The GMI is characterized by thirteen microwave channels ranging in frequency from 10 GHz to 183 GHz. In addition to carrying channels similar to those on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI), the GMI carries four high frequency, millimeter-wave, channels about 166 GHz and 183 GHz. With a 1.2 m diameter antenna, the GMI will provide significantly improved spatial resolution over TMI. \n\nScan Geometry:\n\nThe off-nadir-angle defining the cone swept out by the GMI is set at 48.5 degrees which represents an earth- incidence-angle of 52.8 degrees. To maintain similar geometry with the predecessor TMI instrument, the-earth- incidence angle of GMI was chosen identical to that of the TMI. Rotating at 32 rotations per minute, the GMI will gather microwave radiometric brightness measurements over a 140 degree sector centered about the spacecraft ground track vector. The remaining angular sector is used for performing calibration; i.e. observation of cold space as well as observation of a hot calibration target.\n\nThe 140 degree GMI swath represents a swath of 904 km on the Earth's surface. For comparison, the DPR instrument is characterized by cross-track swath widths of 245 km and 120 km, for the Ku and Ka-band radars respectively. Only the central portions of the GMI swath will overlap the radar swaths (and with approximately 67 second duration between measurements due to the geometry and spacecraft motion). These measurements within the overlapped swaths are important for improving precipitation retrievals, and in particular, the radiometer-based retrievals. \n\nSummary provided by http://pmm.nasa.gov/GPM/flight-project/GMI\n\n\nGroup: Instrument_Details\n   Entry_ID: GMI\n   Group: Instrument_Identification\n      Instrument_Category: Earth Remote Sensing Instruments\n      Instrument_Class: Passive Remote Sensing\n      Instrument_Type: Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Instrument_Subtype: Imaging Spectrometers/Radiometers\n      Short_Name: GMI\n      Long_Name: Global Precipitation Measurement Microwave Imager\n   End_Group\n   Group: Associated_Platforms\n      Short_Name: GPM\n   End_Group\n   Group: Spectral_Frequency_Information\n      Wavelength_Keyword: Microwave\n      Number_Channels: 13\n      Spectral_Frequency_Coverage_Range: 10 GHz to 183 GHz.\n   End_Group\n   Online_Resource: http://pmm.nasa.gov/GPM/flight-project/GMI\n   Creation_Date: 2009-04-29\n   Group: Instrument_Logistics\n      Instrument_Owner: USA/NASA\n   End_Group\nEnd_Group\n"@en ;
