The Ocean Dynamics Satellite (Seasat 1) was designed to provide measurements of sea-surface winds, sea-surface temperatures, wave heights, internal waves, atmospheric liquid water content, sea ice features, ocean features, ocean topography, and the marine geoid. Seasat 1 provided 95% global coverage every 36 h. The instrument payload consisted of (1) an X-band compressed pulse radar altimeter (ALT), (2) a coherent synthetic aperture radar (SAR), (3) a Seasat-A scatterometer system (SASS), (4) a scanning multichannel microwave radiometer (SMMR), and (5) a visible and infrared radiometer (VIRR). The accuracies obtained were distance between spacecraft and ocean surface to 10 cm, wind speeds to 2 m/s, and surface temperatures to 1 deg C. For more information about Seasat 1, see "Seasat mission overview," Science, v. 204, pp. 1405-1424, 1979, and a special issue on the Seasat 1 sensors, IEEE J. of Oceanic Eng., v. OE-5, 1980. On October 10, 1978, Seasat 1 failed due to a massive short circuit in its electrical system. During most of its 105 days in orbit, Seasat 1 returned a unique and extensive set of observations of the earth's oceans.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The fifth Orbiting Geophysical Observatory, OGO-5, was launched on 4 March
1968. The satellite, primarily devoted to Earth observation, was in a highly
elliptical initial orbit with a 272 km perigee and an 148,228 km apogee. The
orbital inclination was 31.1 degrees. The satellite took 3796 minutes to
complete one orbit. Two experiments aboard OGO-5 produced cosmic high- energy
results, although their intended target was the Sun. The spacecraft attitude
control failed on 6 August 1971 and it was placed in a standby mode on 8
October 1971. Three experiments (none of which were related to cosmic
high-energy detection) were reactivated from 1 June to 13 July 1972. Operation
of OGO 5 terminated completely on 14 July 1972.

The Anderson et al. (University of California, Berkeley) Energetic Radiations
from Solar Flares experiment was operational from March 1968 - June 1971.
Primarily devoted to solar observations, it detected at least 11 cosmic X-ray
bursts in time coincidence with gamma-ray bursts seen by other instruments. The
detector was a 0.5 cm thick NaI(Tl) crystal with a 9.5 sq-cm area. Data were
accumulated into energy ranges of: 9.6-19.2, 19.2-32, 32-48, 48-64, 64-80,
80-104, 104-128, and &gt; 128 keV. The data were sampled for 1. 15 seconds once
every 2.3 seconds.

The gamma-ray instrument on-board, sensitive to energies from 25-100 MeV, was a
six gap spark chamber with an effective area of ~ 100 sq-cm. It was called the
Energetic Photons in Primary Cosmic Rays experiment (Hutchinson et al.,
Southampton University). It had an angular resolution of ~ 30 degrees (FWHM).
The satellite was Earth-pointing and passed regularly through the radiation
belts, which led to severe restrictions on the sky regions which could be
examined by the gamma-ray instrument. Other problems, such as an efficiency
reduction in the anti-coincidence shield and data system difficulties, severely
degraded the scientific return from the experiment. Data collection ceased
altogether after 5 months. Gamma-ray emission from the galactic plane was
monitored. No point sources were detected.

Designed as an early generation 747 replacement, the A340-600 flies 380 passengers in a three-class cabin layout (419 in 2 class) over 7,500 nautical miles (13,900 km). It provides similar passenger capacity to a 747 but with 25% more cargo volume, and at lower trip and seat costs. First flight of the A340-600 was made on 23 April 2001. Virgin Atlantic began commercial services in August 2002.

The A340-600 is more than 10 m longer than a basic -300, making it the longest airliner currently in production; more than four metres longer than the Boeing 747-400. The Airbus A340-600 will continue to hold the record for being the worlds longest commercial aircraft until the first Boeing 747-8 Intercontinental is rolled out in 2010. It is powered by four 56,000 lbf (249 kN) thrust Rolls-Royce Trent 556 turbofans. It also has an additional four-wheel undercarriage on the fuselage center-line to cope with the increased MTOW. Airbus has made provisions for freeing additional upper deck main cabin space, by providing optional arrangements for additional facilities such as crew rest areas, galleys, and lavatories upon the "stretched" A340 aircraft's lower decks.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">KOMPSAT-2 (also referred to as Arirang-2 by South Korea) was developed by KARI (Korea Aerospace Research Institute) to continue the observation program of the KOMPSAT-1 mission. The main mission objectives of the KOMPSAT-2 are to provide a surveillance capability for large-scale disasters by acquiring high-resolution imagery for GIS (Geographic Information Systems) applications.

The spacecraft design is based on the KOMPSAT-1 heritage making extensive use of existing hardware, software, tools, and facilities; it allows parallel integration of the payload, equipment, and propulsion modules. The KOMPSAT-2 bus structure consists of the five modules: SMS (Structure and Mechanisms Subsystem), TCS (Thermal ConTrol Subsystem), AOCS (Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem), TC&amp;R (Telemetry Command and Ranging) subsystem, EPS (Electrical Power Subsystem), PS (Propulsion Subsystem), and the FSW (Flight Software) element.

The AOCS provides three-axis stabilization (3-axis control with zero momentum bias system) with high accuracy for roll, pitch and yaw pointing. Star trackers, gyro reference assemblies, three-axis magnetometers, magnetic torquers and reaction wheels are used for attitude sensing and control. The pointing accuracy is &lt; 0.025º in roll and pitch, and 0.08º in yaw. The pointing knowledge is 0.020º in roll and pitch, and 0.045º in yaw. The spacecraft platform offers a cross-track body-pointing capability through roll maneuvers (up to ±45º). The propulsion subsystem makes use of re-used components (hydrazine monopropellant thrusters with blowdown pressure-feed system, 73 kg propellant).

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The primary objective of the STS-99 mission was to complete high resolution mapping of large sections of the Earth's surface using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), a specially modified radar system. This radar system produced unrivaled 3-D images of the Earth's Surface. The mission was launched at 1231 on February 11, 2000 onboard the space shuttle Endeavour, and led by Commander Kevin Kregel. The crew was Pilot Dominic L. Pudwill Gorie and Mission Specialists Janet L. Kavandi, Janice E. Voss, Mamoru Mohri from the National Space Development Agency (Japanese Space Agency), and Gerhard P. J. Thiele from DARA (German Space Agency). This videotape shows a press briefing about a mechanical problem that the shuttle was having. There was discussion about possibly scrubbing the launch due to the problem with the Enhanced Master Events Controller. A problem with a fuel pump part had also become evident and there was discussion about the impact that this could have on the flight.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">TiungSat-1 is Malaysia's first national microsatellite. It was designed and developed in a collaborative effort between the Malaysian government, under the government appointed company ATSB \[Astronautic Technology (Malaysia) Sdn. Bdh.\] of Kuala Lumpur, and SSTL (Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd.) of Surrey, UK. In the view of the Malaysian government, the satellite development program was seen as an impetus for expanding Malaysia's capability in the area of high-technology industry. The first satellite was named "Tiung" after a beautiful small singing bird in Malaysia. Astronautic Technology Sdn. Bhd. (ATSB) is a research and development organization, which was formed in 1995 by the government of Malaysia. 

The TiungSat-1 specific applications are in the following fields:

* Collection of imagery for environmental and meteorological use
* Digital S&amp;F (Store &amp; Forward) communications
* Technology demonstration
* Space science
* Amateur radio access

Spacecraft:

The TiungSat-1 S/C structure comprises eleven module trays used to house the electronics for the bus and payload systems. The box-like spacecraft has a size of 690 mm x 360 mm x 360 mm; it is three-axis stabilized using a gravity-gradient boom (6 m boom with tip mass), two 3-axis magnetorquers, and a momentum wheel. Attitude is sensed by two 3-axis magnetometers and by two-axis analog sun sensors. In addition, there are UED (Underneath Earth Detector) and SOD (Sun Overhead Detector). The pointing knowledge is in roll and pitch and in yaw (3 sigma values). The S/C power is 35 W per panel, provided by four surface-mounted GaAs solar panels and by a 10-cell NiCd battery (7 Ah). The power subsystem provides regulated voltage supplies at +5V and 10V along with an unregulated supply which fluctuates between 12-14 V. Autonomous functions, safe modes and data are handled by two OBCs (On-Board Computer), OBC-186 and OBC-386. Onboard data handling via a CAN (Controller Area Network) between platform and payloads. The onboard data storage capacity is 1 Gbit. The S/C mass is 50 kg (platform = 35 kg, payload = 15 kg). The nominal design life is three years.

RF communications: TiungSat uses conventional AMSAT frequencies (Malaysian Oscar-46), thereby giving amateur radio operators access to its data (imagery and communication capabilities). The microsatellite features an AX.25 protocol store-and-forward PACSAT protocol suite communications system. The uplink is in VHF-band with a data rate of 9.6 kbit/s; three receivers are used: Rx1 operates at 144.46 MHz, Rx2 and Rx3 operate at 145.86 145.925 MHz, selectable. The downlink is dual-redundant in UHF-band (435 to 438 MHz range with 437.300, 437.325, 437.350, 437.375 MHz, selectable) with data rates of 9.6, and 38.4 kbit/s (experimentally at 76.8 kit/s). An error-protected digital packet communications protocol is used. All spacecraft operations are performed at ATSB in Kuala Lumpur.

TiungSat-1 was launched Sept. 26, 2000 on a Dnepr-1 vehicle along with other satellites (the other payloads were: SaudiSat-1A/-1B of SISR (Saudi Institute for Space Research), UniSat of the University of Rome, and MegSat-1 of the MegSat Space Division of "Gruppo Meggiorin," Bresia, Italy) from the Baikonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan.

Orbit: Circular orbit, altitude = 650 km, inclination = 64, period = 97 minutes.

Spacecraft operations are carried out at ATSB's Mission Control Station located at the Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Bangi, Selangor. The satellite has also been used in a number of educational activities ranging from the physical sciences to the humanities.

Operational status of TiungSat-1 as of 2004: The payload was fully operational well beyond its design life of three years. However, since Jan. 2004, the payload is only being operated intermittently to reduce the power consumption of the battery.

Sensor/experiment complement (MSEIS, MEIS, S&amp;F, CEDEX):

MSEIS (Multi-Spectral Earth Imaging System). MSEIS is a NAC (Narrow Angle Camera), a multispectral system of three cameras (green, red and near-infrared) in parallel, each with a 75 mm focal length optic and 100 mm aperture diameter. The NAC system provides a 78 m ground spatial resolution in three spectral bands: 510-590 nm, 610-690 nm and 810-890 nm (green, red, and near infrared). A two-dimensional CCD staring array detector with 1024 x 1024 pixels is used providing snapshot imagery of scene size 78 km x 78 km. Up to four contiguous images can be collected along the flight path. The data are digitized to 8 bits radiometric resolution (256 levels).

MEIS (Metrological Earth Imaging System). MEIS is a single-band WAC (Wide Angle Camera) system with 6.5 mm focal length optics. It provides NIR imagery (810-890 nm) with a 900 m spatial resolution. The CCD area array detector has a size of 1024 x 1024 elements (pixels) for snapshot observations. Data are quantized to 8 bits radiometric resolution. An image has the size of 900 km x 900 km. The data is being used for meteorological applications.

S&amp;F (Digital Store &amp; Forward Communications). The subsystem provides global, frequency-agile, communications for any form of digitized data: e-mail, voice-mail, scientific data exchange, fax, imagery, or even Internet mail for remote regions. The low cost and direct access offered by the TiungSat-1 microsatellite in orbit also makes it ideal for use by scientists, engineers and students based in institutes, universities and even schools throughout the world. - DSPE (Digital Signal Processing Experiment). The DSPE consists of a TM320C31 low power DSP suitable for special or general purpose signal processing tasks on LEO satellites. The VHF scanner operates in the 140-150 MHz range. A built-in FSK decoder is used. The system is capable to detect signals from a pre-set signal strength threshold within selected bar. DSP can be used for processing audio transmission for rebroadcast.

CEDEX (Cosmic Ray Energy Deposition Experiment). The objective of CEDEX is to characterize the TiungSat-1 orbit radiation environment in terms of the observed particle LET (Linear Energy Transfer) spectrum at the spacecraft. The primary sensor consists of a 30mm x 30mm PIN diode detector 300 microns in depth, housed in a separate screened aluminium unit mounted on the CEDEX module box (three area PIN-diode detectors are mounted in a "telescopic" arrangement; hence, information pertaining to directions of the energy particles detected can be derived.). This is connected to a charge amplifier and a pulse-shaping circuit which, in turn, are connected to an event-driven, hardware-logic controlled pulse-height multi-channel analyzer. CEDEX is controlled autonomously by a CAN-microcontroller with its own data-storage RAM and built-in data-compression software. This sends data to an internal CAN-controller which formats and sends them on to the primary OBC via the spacecraft's CAN (Controlled Area Network) bus. CEDEX is a multichannel analyzer with 512 channels and a 0.5 pC (picocoulomb) charge resolution. The instrument charge range is between 0.2 -24 pC, equivalent to a normal incidence particle LET range of about 60 - 7500 MeV cm2 g-1 (200,000 particles/s).

The CEDEX data obtained are comparable directly with such instruments as CREDO-II flown on STRV-1c (launch Nov. 16, 2000) and CRE (Cosmic Ray Experiment) flown on KitSat-1 (launch Aug. 10, 1992) and PoSat-1 (launch Sept. 26, 1993).

Experimental Microsatellite GPS, an SSTL/ESA collaboration. An advanced 12-channel GPS receiver with two GPS patch antennas is installed for several objectives: 1) onboard generation of Keplerian orbital elements (NORAD experiment, this was first performed on PoSat), 2) onboard navigation, attitude, and timing services, and 3) refractive sounding of the ionosphere. The instrument is primarily used for orbit and position determination and for precise onboard timing services. In parallel, the instrument is also employed for refractive ionospheric monitoring. The TEC (Total Electron Content) occultation observations of the instrument provide slant range measurements which can be converted into vertical profiles.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The STS-64 mission will carry the LIDAR In-Space Technology Experiment (LITE), a project to measure atmospheric parameters from a space platform utilizing laser sensors, the Robot Operated Materials Processing System (ROMPS) to investigate robot handling of thin film samples, and the Shuttle Pointed Autonomous Research Tool for Astronomy (SPARTAN-201). SPARTAN is a free-flying retrievable platform with two telescopes to study the solar wind, a continuous stream of electrons, heavy protons and heavy ions ejected from the sun and traveling through space at speeds of almost 1 million miles per hour. The solar wind frequently causes problems on Earth by disrupting navigation, communications and electrical power.

The STS-64 mission will also carry the Shuttle Plume Impingement Flight Experiment (SPIFEX). This experiment is designed to directly measure RCS plume loads in the far-field regime under actual on-orbit conditions. Discovery's payload bay also contains a GAS bridge assembly with 12 GAS canisters (G-178, G-254, G-312, G-325, G-417, G-453, G-454, G-456, G-485, G-506 and G-562). One additional experiment in the payload bay is the Trajectory Control Sensor (TCS) package positioned on an Adaptive Payload Carrier. It will provide relative trajectory data on a target vehicle operating in close proximity (less than 5000ft) of the Orbiter. The TCS will provide range and range rate data for target vehicles having a reflective surface. Additionally, the TCS provides bearing, bearing rate, attitude, and attitude rates for target vehicles utilizing special retro-reflectors.

In Discovery's middeck area, STS-64 will carry the Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue (SAFER) system, the Solid Surface Combustion Experiment (SSCE), the Biological Research in Canister III (BRIC-III) experiment, the Radiation Monitoring Equipment III (RME-III) experiment. Other experiments onboard STS-64 include Military Application of Ship Trails (MAST), Shuttle Amateur Radio Experiment-II (SAREX-II) and Air Force Maui Optical Site Calibration Test (AMOS).

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The mission of GEOS 3 (Geodynamics Experimental Ocean Satellite) was to provide
the stepping stone between the National Geodetic Satellite Program (NGSP) and
the Earth and Ocean Physics Application Program.  It provided data to refine
the geodetic and geophysical results of the NGSP and served as a test for new
systems.  A major achievment was the flight of a radar altimeter.  Further
mission objectives: intercomparison of tracking systems, investigation of
solid-earth dynamic phenomena through precision laser tracking, refinement of
orbit determination techniques, determination of interdatum ties and gravity
models, and support of the calibration and position determination of NASA
Spaceflight Tracking and Data Network (STDN) S-band tracking stations.   For

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">WIND was launched on November 1, 1994 and is the first of two NASA spacecraft in the Global Geospace Science initiative and part of the ISTP Project. WIND was positioned in a sunward, multiple double-lunar swingby orbit with a maximum apogee of 250Re during the first two years of operation. This was followed by a halo orbit at the Earth-Sun L1 point.

The science objectives of the WIND mission are:
- Provide conplete plasma, energetic particle, and magnetic field input for
magnetospheric and ionospheric studies.
- Determine the magnetospheric output to interplanetary space in the
up-stream region
- Investigate basic plasma processes occuring in the near-Earth solar wind
- Provide baseline ecliptic plane observations to be used in heliospheric
latitudes from ULYSSES. 

WIND carries the following instruments:
Radio and Plasma Wave experiment  (WAVES)
Energetic Particle Acceleration, Composition, and Transport (EPACT)
Solar Wind Experiment (SWE)
Solar Wind and Suprathermal Ion Composition Studies (SWICS/MASS/STICS)
Magnetic Fields Investigation (MFI)

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Orbiting Geophysical Observatory 3 (OGO 3) was launched on 7 June 1966 and
put into orbit of 295 x 122,219 km at 31 degrees inclination. All 21
experiments returned good data. At the time, this was the largest experimental
complement ever put into orbit. There were 4 cosmic ray instruments (1 of which
included a gamma-ray spectrometer), 4 plasma, 2 trapped radiation, 2 magnetic
fields, 5 ionosphere, 3 radio/optical, and 1 micrometeoroid detectors. Again,
the GSFC positron search and gamma-ray spectrometer was included. The
experiment was essentially identical to what was flown on OGO 1, with the PMTs
being replaced by an improved variety. This time, the experiment was successful
in achieving all of its objectives. OGO 3 maintained 3-axis stabilization for
46 days. At that point, an attitude controller failed and the spacecraft was
put into a spin on 23 July 1966. The spin period varied from 90-125 seconds. By
June 1969, data acquisition was limited to 50% of the orbital path. Routine
operation was discontinued on 1 December 1969, and complete termination
occurred on 29 February 1972.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">A long-range Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) for oceanographic research. A  suite of miniaturized physical and bio-optical instruments, which measure in  situ water properties including temperature, salinity, and the absorption and  scattering of light in the water column, have been and are currently under  development for placement in the glider&amp;#039;s science payload bay. Seagliders fly  through the water with extremely modest energy requirements using changes in  buoyancy for thrust coupled with a stable, low-drag, hydrodynamic shape.  Designed to operate at depths up to 1000 meters, the hull compresses as it  sinks, matching the compressibility of seawater.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">ADEOS (ADvanced Earth Observation Satellite), developed by the Japanese space agency JAXA. It  was the largest satellite Japan has ever developed, having dimensions of 4 x 4 x 5 m. When antenna and the solar array paddle (approx. 3 x 24 m) were deployed, it had a span of 11m in the flight direction and 29 m in the perpendicular direction.It had a launch mass of approximatly 3500 kg and an in-orbit power generation capability of approximatly 4500W.
The spacecraft consisted of a mission module and a bus module.The bus module was made of thermally, electrically and mechanically independent units, including the Communications and Data Handling Subsystem, the Electrical Power Subsystem (EPS), the Attitude and Orbital Control Subsystem (AOCS) and the reaction Control Subsystem (RCS) for orbital maneuvers.

The mission module carried 8 instruments : Two core sensor developped by JAXA : AVNIR (Advanced Visible and Near Infrared Radiometer) and OCTS (Ocean Color and Temperature Temperature Sensor).Six Annoncement of Opportunity (AO) sensors : NSACT (NASA SCATterometer), TOMS (Total Ozone Mapping Spectometer), POLDER (POlarization and Directionality of the Earth'Reflectance), IMG (Interferometric Monitor for Greenhouse Gases), ILAS (Improved Limb Atmospheric Spectrometer), RIS (Retroreflector In Space).ADEOS-1 has been launched in August 1996 by H-II launcher from Tanegashima Space Center. Ninety seconds after liftoff, the solid rocket boosters separated from the H-II vehicle and 6 minutes after liftoff, the first stage separated. Then 16 minutes after liftoff, ADEOS-1 separated from the second stage. ADEOS-1 was lost on June 1997, the 30th, due to a solar panel cable breaking.[http://smsc.cnes.fr/POLDER/index.htm]

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Spacecraft Brief Description
  The  PAGEOS (Passive Geodetic Earth Orbiting Satellite) spacecraft was
  a  30.48-m inflatable sphere, and had no instrumentation on board.  It
  was  the  second  (following  GEOS  1)  NASA satellite in the National
  Geodetic  Satellites  Program.  PAGEOS 1 was made up of 84 gores and 2
  pole  caps  of  0.0127-mm  aluminized mylar film.  The gores were 48 m
  long  with  maximum  width  of 1.24 m and the pole caps were 1.02 m in
  diameter.   The  primary  purpose  of  the  satellite was to provide a
  tracking  target for geodetic purposes.  It had a specular reflectance
  of  0.862,  and a diffuse reflectance of 0.029, providing a reflecting
  light   source   whose   brightness   was  relatively  independent  of
  observer-satellite-sun   phase   angle.   The  surface  was  also  97%
  reflectant  for microwave energy in the range from 17 to 4E5 kHz.  The
  launch,  orbit,  separation,  inflation  and  initial  operation  were
  nominal,  with  more  than  40  ground  stations  participating in the
  observation  program.  The orbit was generally considered too high for
  drag-density  study,  although  some work was done in this area by the
  Smithsonian   Astrophysical   Observatory.     For   a  more  detailed
  description,  see  David  E.  Bowker,  'PAGEOS  Project Compilation of
  Information  for  Use  of  Experimenter' (TRF B01718), NASA-TM-X-1344,

Landsat 5 has significantly exceeded its designed life expectancy, and has a
maximum transmission bandwidth of 85 Mbit/s. It was deployed at an altitude of
705.3 km, a lower orbit than Landsat 4. It takes some 16 days to scan the
entire Earth. The satellite is an identical copy of Landsat 4 and was
originally intended as a backup - it therefore carries the same instruments,
including the Thematic Mapper and Multi-Spectral Scanner. The Multi-Spectral
Scanner was powered down in 1995.

DMSP 5D-1/F2 was one of a series of meteorological satellites developed and operated by the Air Force under the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). This program, previously known as DAPP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objectives of this program were to provide global visual and infrared cloud cover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense requirements. Operationally, the program consisted of two satellites in planned 830-km sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other at local noon. The 5.4-m long spacecraft was separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform (PMP) for sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment, (2) an equipment support module (ESM) containing the electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors, (3) a reaction control equipment (RCE) support structure (that has the third-stage motor, hydrazine reaction control system) which supports (4) a 9.29 sq mm solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization was controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system so sensors could be maintained in the desired `earth-looking' mode. One feature was the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allowed automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element. The operational line scan system (OLS) built by Westinghouse, was the primary data acquisition system that provided real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night visual and infrared imagery at 1/3-nautical-mile resolution for all major land masses, 1-1/2-nautical-mile resolution for complete global coverage, and provided with this data calibration, timing, and other auxiliary signals to the spacecraft for digital transmission to the ground. A supplementary sensor package, the special sensor H (SSH), a step-scanning radiometer, was the infrared temperature-humidity-ozone sounder. The data processing system, which included three high-density tape recorders, was capable of storing a total of 400 min of data, each allowing full global coverage twice daily. Either recorded or real-time data were transmitted to ground-receiving sites via two redundant S-band transmitters. Recorded data were read out to tracking sites located at Fairchild AFB, WA, and Loring AFB, ME, and relayed via SATCOM to Air Force Global Weather Central, Offutt AFB, NE. Real-time data were read out at mobile tactical sites located around the world. A more complete description of the satellite can be found in the report, `The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program,' D. A. Nichols, Optical Engineering, 14, 4, July - August 1975.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">NASA's AIM spacecraft began its two-year mission April 25, 2007 after a flawless ride to Earth orbit aboard an Orbital Sciences Pegasus XL rocket. Launch took place at 1:26 PDT. Launch operations at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California ran smoothly, with no technical or weather issues causing concern.

The AIM mission is the first dedicated to exploring mysterious ice clouds that dot the edge of space in Earth's polar regions. These clouds have grown brighter and more prevalent in recent years and some scientists suggest that changes in these clouds may be the result of climate change.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The purpose of the Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor III (ACRIM III)
instrument is to study total solar Irradiance from the Sun. The ACRIM III
package is flying on a spacecraft called ACRIMSAT. The spacecraft was launched
on December 20, 1999 as a secondary payload on a Taurus launch vehicle. ACRIM
III, third in a series of long-term solar-monitoring tools built for NASA by
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, will continue to extend the database first
created by ACRIM I, which was launched in 1980 on the Solar Maximum Mission
(SMM) spacecraft. ACRIM II followed on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite
(UARS) in 1991. ACRIMSAT data will be correlated with possible global warming
data, ice cap shrinkage data, and ozone layer depletion data. It is theorized
that as much as 25 percent of the Earth's total global warming may be solar in
origin due to small increases in the Sun's total energy output since the last
century. By measuring incoming solar radiation and adding measurements of ocean
and atmosphere currents and temperatures, as well as surface temperatures,
climatologists will be able to improve their predictions of climate and global
warming over the next century. Energy forecasting, carbon management, public
health.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Voyager 2 was one of a pair of spacecraft launched to explore the planets of the outer solar system and the interplanetary environment. Each Voyager had as its major objectives at each planet to: (1) investigate the circulation, dynamics, structure, and composition of the planet's atmosphere; (2) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the satellites of the planet; (3) provide improved values for the mass, size, and shape of the planet, its satellites, and any rings; and, (4) determine the magnetic field structure and characterize the composition and distribution of energetic trapped particles and plasma therein.

Originally planned as a Grand Tour of the outer planets, including dual launches to Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto in 1976-77 and dual launches to Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune in 1979, budgetary constraints caused a dramatic rescoping of the project to two spacecraft, each of which would go to only Jupiter and Saturn. The new mission was called Mariner Jupiter/Saturn, or MJS. It was subsequently renamed Voyager about six months prior to launch. The rescoped mission was estimated to cost $250 million (through the end of Saturn operations), only a third of what the Grand Tour design would have cost.

Voyager 2 was the first of the two spacecraft to be launched, with liftoff occurring 20 Aug. 1977. What was at first an auspicious launch, however, proved to be the beginning of a number of problems. The primary cause of the initial problems were attributed to commanding by the AACS, including difficulty in determining the full deployment of the science boom. These problems resulted in a delay of four days in the launch of Voyager 1 to ensure they wouldn't occur for it.

Although launched sixteen days after Voyager 2, Voyager 1's trajectory was the quicker one to Jupiter. On 15 Dec. 1977, while both spacecraft were in the asteroid belt, Voyager 1 surpassed Voyager 2's distance from the Sun.

Several months after launch, in April 1978, Voyager 2's primary radio receiver failed, automatically kicking in the backup receiver which proved to be faulty. Attempts to recover the use of the primary receiver failed and the backup receiver was used for the remainder of the mission. Although use of the backup receiver made communication with the spacecraft more difficult, engineers were able to find workarounds.

Voyager 2 proceeded with its primary mission and flew by Jupiter (closest approach on 09 July 1979) and Saturn (05 Aug. 1981). During these flybys, Voyager 2 obtained images roughly equal in number to Voyager 1 (18,000 at Jupiter, 16,000 at Saturn).

Voyager 2's launch date had preserved one part of the original Grand Tour design, i.e. the possibility of an extended mission to Uranus and Neptune. Despite the difficulties encountered, scientists and engineers had been able to make Voyager enormously successful. As a result, approval was granted to extend the mission, first to Uranus, then to Neptune and later to continue observations well past Neptune. Voyager 2 made successful flybys of Uranus (24 Jan. 1986) and Neptune (25 Aug. 1989). Because of the additional distance of these two planets, adaptations had to made to accomodate the lower light levels and decreased communications. Voyager 2 was successfully able to obtain about 8,000 images of Uranus and its satellites. Additional improvements in the on-board software and use of image compression techniques allowed about 10,000 images of Neptune and its satellites to be taken.

All of the experiments on Voyager 2 have produced useful data.

                  - Spacecraft Brief Description -
Spacelab 2, a NASA developed payload, had a configuration that included an
igloo attached to a lead pallet, with the Instrument Pointing Subsystem (IPS)
mounted on it, a two pallet train, and an experiment special support structure.
The flight objective was to demonstrate Spacelab's capabilities through a
multidisciplinary research program and to verify system performance.
Investigations in the field of astrophysics and solar astronomy included a sky
survey for extended infrared sources, x-ray imaging of cluster galaxies, cosmic
ray measurements, studies of small-scale structures on the sun's surface, and a
measurement of the coronal helium abundance. In addition, there were
measurements of: the solar ultraviolet flux; the plasma environment and plasma
processes near the Orbiter; and zero-gravity effects on technology processes
and on the behavior of liquid helium. Life sciences problems investigated
included bone demineralization in humans and lignin formation in plants.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Solrad 10, known as Explorer 44 before launch, was the third in
a series of small satellites launched by the US Naval Research
Laboratory to study the Sun. It went into orbit on 8 July
1971. It was in an eccentric orbit, with apogee 630 km, perigee
436 km, and inclination 51 degrees. The orbital period was just
over 95 minutes. The satellite was spin stabilized at 60
rpm. The satellite spin axis was pointed toward the Sun. All of
the solar X-ray and UV sensors were located on the Sun-facing
end parallel to the spin axis. The satellite was 12 sided, with
a diameter of 0.76 m and a height of 0.59 m. It weighed about
118 kg. Solrad 10's scientific instruments were dedicated to
studying the solar electromagnetic radiation, specifically in
the UV/X-ray region. However, it could be commanded to study
radiations from other stellar sources. The spacecraft descended
into the atmosphere on 15 December 1979.

The primary goal of the GRACE mission is to accurately map variations in the Earth's gravity field over its 5-year lifetime. The GRACE mission has two identical spacecrafts flying about 220 kilometers apart in a polar orbit 500 kilometers above the Earth. 

It maps the Earth's gravity fields by making accurate measurements of the distance between the two satellites, using geodetic quality Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers and a microwave ranging system. This provides scientists from all over the world with an efficient and cost-effective way to map the Earth's gravity fields with unprecedented accuracy. The results from this mission yield crucial information about the distribution and flow of mass within the Earth and it's surroundings.

The gravity variations that GRACE studies include: changes due to surface and deep currents in the ocean; runoff and ground water storage on land masses; exchanges between ice sheets or glaciers and the oceans; and variations of mass within the Earth. Another goal of the mission is to create a better profile of the Earth's atmosphere. The results from GRACE make a huge contribution to NASA's Earth science goals, Earth Observation System (EOS) and global climate change studies.

GRACE is a joint partnership between the NASA in the United States and Deutsche Forschungsanstalt fur Luft und Raumfahrt (DLR) in Germany. Dr. Byron Tapley of The University of Texas Center for Space Research (UTCSR) is the Principal Investigator (PI), and Dr. Christoph Reigber of the GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ) Potsdam is the Co-Principal Investigator (Co-PI). Project management and systems engineering activities are carried out by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Nimbus-1 was launched in August 1964 and was the first in a series of
second-generation meteorological research-and-development satellites that was
designed to serve as a stabilized, earth-oriented platform for the testing of
advanced meteorological sensor systems and for collecting meteorological data.
The polar-orbiting spacecraft consisted of three major elements: (1) a sensory
ring, (2) solar paddles, and (3) the control system housing. The solar paddles
and the control system housing were connected to the sensory ring by a truss
structure, giving the satellite the appearance of an ocean buoy. Nimbus-1 was
nearly 3.7 m tall, 1.5 m in diameter at the base, and about 3 m across with
solar paddles extended. The sensory ring, which formed the satellite base,
housed the electronics equipment and battery modules. The lower surface of the
torus-shaped sensory ring provided mounting space for sensors and telemetry
antennas. An H-frame structure mounted within the center of the torus provided
support for the larger experiments and tape recorders. Mounted on the control
system housing, which was located on top of the spacecraft, were sun sensors,
horizon scanners, gas nozzles for attitude control, and a command antenna. Use
of a stabilization and control system allowed the spacecraft's orientation to
be controlled to within plus or minus 1 degree for all three axes (pitch, roll,
and yaw).
The spacecraft carried an advanced vidicon camera system for recording and
storing remote cloudcover pictures, an automatic picture transmission camera
for providing real-time cloudcover pictures, and a high-resolution infrared
radiometer to complement the daytime TV coverage and to measure nighttime
radiative temperatures of cloud tops and surface terrain. A short second-stage
burn resulted in an unplanned eccentric orbit. Otherwise, the spacecraft and
its experiments operated successfully until September 22, 1964.  The solar
paddles became locked in position, resulting in inadequate electrical power to
continue operations.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">GEMINI 3 was the first manned Earth-orbiting spacecraft of the GEMINI series. Its primary objective was to demonstrate the manned qualifications of the GEMINI spacecraft. A synergistic effect of zero-g and radiation on white blood cells experiment, a sea urchin egg growth under zero-g experiment, and one technological experiment were conducted. Several of the photographs taken by the astronauts were later considered suitable for synoptic terrain studies. After 5 hours, the spacecraft successfully reentered the atmosphere and landed 60 n.m. (111 km) from the target area.

DMSP 5D-2/F9 is one of a series of meteorological satellites developed and operated by the Air Force under the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). This program, previously known as DAPP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objective of this program is to provide global visual and infrared cloudcover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense operational weather analysis and forecasting requirements. Operationally, the program consists of two satellites in planned 830-km, sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other at local noon. The 6.4-m-long spacecraft is separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform for sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment; (2) an equipment support module containing the electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors; (3) a reaction control equipment support structure containing the third-stage rocket motor and supporting the ascent phase reaction control equipment; and (4) a 9.29-sq-m solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization is controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system so sensors are maintained in the desired "earth-looking" mode. One feature is the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allows automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element. The operational linescan system is the primary data acquisition system that provides real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night visual and infrared imagery of clouds. A supplementary sensor package contains four special sensors: (1) an advanced X-ray spectrometer, (2) an ionospheric/scintillation monitor, (3) a precipitating electron/ion spectrometer, and (4) an infrared temperature and moisture sounder. Either recorded or real-time data are transmitted to ground-receiving sites by two redundant S-band transmitters. Recorded data are read out to tracking sites located at Fairchild AFB, Washington, and at Loring AFB, Maine, and relayed by SATCOM to Air Force Global Weather Center, Offutt AFB, Nebraska. Real-time data are read out at mobile tactical sites located around the world. Additional information concerning this satellite program can be found in the report by D.A. Nichols, "The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program," Optical Engineering, v. 14, n. 4, p. 273, July-August 1975.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">This NRL satellite was one of the Solrad series that began
in 1960 to provide continuous coverage of solar radiation
with a set of standard photometers. Solrad 9 was a
spin-stabilized satellite oriented with its spin axis
perpendicular to the sun-satellite line so that the
14 solar X-ray and UV photometers pointing radially
outward from its equatorial belt viewed the sun with
each revolution.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The main objective of the HINOTORI mission was the detailed study of solar flares during solar maximum. Principal investigations were (1) imaging of solar flare X rays in the range 10 to 40 keV by means of rotating modulation collimators and (2) spectroscopy of X-ray emission lines from highly ionized iron in solar flares in the range 1.7 to 2.0 A by means of a Bragg spectrometer. Wavelength scanning was achieved by the spacecraft revolution, with an offset pointing of the spin axis with respect to the sun. Investigations (1) and (2) each had a time resolution of 6 s. In addition, the following investigations were included: three solar flare X-ray monitors that recorded the time profile and spectrum of the X-ray flares in the range 2 to 20 keV, a solar flare gamma-ray detector for the range 0.2 to 9.0 MeV, a particle detector that monitored electron flux above 100 keV, and plasma probes for the measurement of electron density and temperature.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">In April 1958 Lockheed corporation won a US Navy competition to find a replacement for the Navy's aging P2V Neptune series of long range antisubmarine warfare and maritime patrol aircraft. Lockheed's winning proposal was designated "P3V Orion". Named for the winter constellation of the mighty hunter, the Orion was actually derived from the famous Lockheed Electra civil airliner.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Voyager 1 was one of a pair of spacecraft launched to explore the planets of the outer solar system and the interplanetary environment. Each Voyager had as its major objectives at each planet to: (1) investigate the circulation, dynamics, structure, and composition of the planet's atmosphere; (2) characterize the morphology, geology, and physical state of the satellites of the planet; (3) provide improved values for the mass, size, and shape of the planet, its satellites, and any rings; and, (4) determine the magnetic field structure and characterize the composition and distribution of energetic trapped particles and plasma therein.

Originally planned as a Grand Tour of the outer planets, including dual launches to Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto in 1976-77 and dual launches to Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune in 1979, budgetary constraints caused a dramatic rescoping of the project to two spacecraft, each of which would go to only Jupiter and Saturn. The new mission was called Mariner Jupiter/Saturn, or MJS. It was subsequently renamed Voyager about six months prior to launch. The rescoped mission was estimated to cost $250 million (through the end of Saturn operations), only a third of what the Grand Tour design would have cost.

Originally scheduled to launch twelve days after Voyager 2, Voyager 1's launch was delayed twice to prevent the occurrence of problems which Voyager 2 experienced after launch. Voyager 1's launch finally happened on 05 Sept. 1977 and was termed "flawless and accurate".

Although launched sixteen days after Voyager 2, Voyager 1's trajectory was the quicker one to Jupiter. On 15 Dec. 1977, while both spacecraft were in the asteroid belt, Voyager 1 surpassed Voyager 2's distance from the Sun. Voyager 1 then proceeded to Jupiter (making its closest approach on 05 March 1979) and Saturn (with closest approach on 12 Nov. 1980). Both prior to and after planetary encounters observations were made of the interplanetary medium. Some 18,000 images of Jupiter and its satellites were taken by Voyager 1. In addition, roughly 16,000 images of Saturn, its rings and satellites were obtained.

After its encounter with Saturn, Voyager 1 remained relatively quiescent, continuing to make in situ observations of the interplanetary environment and UV observations of stars. After nearly nine years of dormancy, Voyager 1's cameras were once again turned on to take a series of pictures. On 14 Feb. 1990, Voyager 1 looked back from whence it came and took the first "family portrait" of the solar system, a mosaic of 60 frames of the Sun and six of the planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) as seen from "outside" the solar system. After this final look back, the cameras on Voyager 1 were once again turned off.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Sciences - 3 (ATLAS-03) is the primary payload aboard STS-66. It will continue the series of Spacelab flights to study the energy of the sun and how it affects the Earth's climate and environment. The ATLAS 3 mission will make the first detailed measurements from the Shuttle of the Northern Hemisphere's middle atmosphere in late fall. The timing of the flight, when the Antarctic ozone hole is diminishing, allows scientists to study possible effects of the ozone hole on mid-latitudes, the way Antarctic air recovers, and how the northern atmosphere changes as the winter season approaches.

In addition to the ATLAS-03 investigations, the mission will include deployment and retrieval of the Cryogenic Infrared Spectrometer Telescopefor Atmosphere, or CRISTA. Mounted on the Shuttle Pallet Satellite, the payload is designed to explore the variability of the atmosphere and provide measurements that will complement those obtained by the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite launched aboard Discovery in 1991. CRISTA-SPAS is a joint U.S./German experiment.

Other payloads in Atlantis cargo bay include the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SSBUV-7) payload and the Experiment on the Sun Complementing ATLAS (ESCAPE-II). Payloads located in the middeck include the Physiological &amp; Anatomical Rodent Experiment (PARE/NIR-R), Protein Crystal Growth-Thermal Enclosure (PCG-TES), Protein Crystal Growth- Single Locker (PCG-STES), Space Tissue Loss/National Institute of Health (STL/NIH-C), Space Acceleration Measurement System (SAMS) and the Heat Pipe Performance-2 Experiment (HPP-2).

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Explorer 39 was an inflatable sphere, 3.6 m in diameter.  It was orbited to make atmospheric density determinations.  The spacecraft was successfully launched into a nearly polar, highly elliptical orbit.  It was folded and carried into orbit, together with ejection and inflation equipment, as part of the payload of Explorer 40.  Two density experiments were performed.  One involved the study of systematic density variation, and the other was concerned with nonsystematic density changes.  The upper atmospheric densities were derived from sequential observations of the sphere by use of an attached 136.620-MHz radio tracking beacon and by optical tracking. The radio beacon ceased transmitting in June 1971.  Since that time it has been necessary to rely solely on the SAO Baker-Nunn camera network for tracking.  Explorer 39 had an expected orbital lifetime of 50 years.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">A Grumman Gulfstream III (G-III) business jet has been modified and instrumented by NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center to serve as a multi-role cooperative research platform testbed for a variety of flight research experiments. The twin-turbofan aircraft provides long-term capability for efficient testing of subsonic flight experiments for NASA, the U.S. Air Force, other government agencies, academia, and private industry. The aircraft, which carried the military designation of C-20A, was obtained from the U.S. Air Force in 2003.

NASA Dryden's G-III is equipped with a self-contained on-board Data Collection and Processing System (DCAPS). This embedded instrumentation system allows for automated configuration setups to reduce required engineering support for each mission. It includes primary and backup systems to assure mission reliability, with the backup system available for use concurrently as a slave system when needed. DCAPS is designed to allow easy upgrades, addition of add-on systems for expansion, and to operate in both autonomous and manual modes.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The SPOT-1 (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre) spacecraft was
launched on February 22, 1986.  SPOT-1 is an earth observation satellite
with a greater ground resolution than that of the Landsat series satellites.
The main applications for the images returned by the first SPOT mission are
land-use studies, agriculture and forestry resources, mineral and oil
resources, and cartography. The three-axis stabilized satellite operates in
a circular sun-synchronous near-polar orbit for a design lifetime of 2 years.
Orbital Characteristics-
        Orbital Period:  101.40 m
        Inclination:  98.70 degrees        Eccentricity:  0.00101
        Periapsis:    815.00 km              Apoapsis:  829.60 km

The spacecraft dimensions are 2 x 2 x 3.5 m and 15.60 m for the overall
length of the deployed solar panel. SPOT-1 consists of two parts:
(1) the bus, a standard multipurpose platform, and (2) the payload. The
bus provides housekeeping information and an onboard computer. The payload
is mounted on one of the side panels of the bus.

SPOT-1 consists of two identical high-resolution visible (HRV)
imaging instruments and a package comprising two magnetic-tape data recorders
and a telemetry transmitter. The HRV imaging instrument observes in three
spectral bands (in the visible and near infrared regions) with a ground
resolution of 20 m, and/or in a broader spectral band (panchromatic black and
white) with a ground resolution of 10 m. The pattern of successive ground
tracks is repeated exactly at 26-day intervals. The SPOT-1 instrument package
has the provision for off-nadir viewing which should be particularly useful for
monitoring localized phenomena evolving on a relatively short timescale.
SPOT-1, also, provides the capability for recording stereoscopic pairs of
images of a given area during successive satellite passes.
*NOTE-SPOT1 is used for technological experiments such as : refocusing,
batteries, etc,...
*NOTE-SPOT1 is no more used for commercial image acquisition.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">                  - Spacecraft Brief Description -
The Magsat project was a joint NASA/United States Geological Survey (USGS)
effort to measure near-earth magnetic fields on a global basis. Objectives
included obtaining an accurate description of the earth's magnetic field,
obtaining data for use in the update and refinement of world and regional
magnetic charts, compilation of a global crustal magnetic anomaly map, and
interpretation of that map in terms of geologic/geophysical models of the
earth's crust. The spacecraft was launched into a low, near-polar, orbit by the
Scout vehicle. The basic spacecraft was made up of two distinct parts: the
instrument module that contained a vector and a scalar magnetometer and their
unique supporting gear; and the base module that contained the necessary
data-handling, power, communications, command, and attitude-control subsystems
to support the instrument module. The base module complete with its subsystems
was comprised of residual Small Astronomy Satellite (SAS-C) hardware. The
magnetometers were deployed after launch to a position 6 m behind the
spacecraft. At this distance, the influence of magnetic materials from the
instrument and base module (chiefly from the star cameras) was less than 1 nT.

     ATS 1 was launched in December 1966 and was the first in a series of
geostationary satellites to be used in a research mode, while also
demonstrating communications satellite technology.  It was designed for the
purpose of (1) testing new concepts in spacecraft design, propulsion, and
stabilization, (2) collecting high-quality cloudcover pictures and relaying
processed meteorological data via an earth-synchronous satellite, (3) providing
in situ measurements of the aerospace environment, and (4) testing improved
communication systems.  The spin-stabilized spacecraft was cylindrically shaped
and measured 135 cm long and 142 cm in diameter.  The primary structural
members were a honeycombed equipment shelf and thrust tube.  Support rods
extended radially outward from the thrust tube.  Solar panels were affixed to
the support rods and formed the outer walls of the spacecraft.  In addition to
solar panels, the spacecraft was equipped with two rechargeable nickel-cadmium
batteries to provide electrical power.  Equipment components and payload were
mounted in the annular space between the thrust tube and solar panels.
This satellite carried a spin scan cloudcover camera, particle telescope,
biaxal fluxgate magnetometer, suprathermal ion detector, omnidirectional
spectrometer, weather facsimile data relay system, and VHF, telemetry and
command antennas.  Spacecraft  guidance  and  orbital corrections were
accomplished by a 2.3 kg hydrogen peroxide and hydrazine thrusters, which were
activated by ground command.  The satellite was initially placed at 151.16
degrees West over the Pacific Ocean in a geosynchronous orbit.  In general,
most of the experiments were successful.  Data coverage was nominal until about
1970, after which limited real-time data acquisition was carried out by NOAA
until the May 1974 launch of SMS 1.  Limited ATS 1 data acquisition was started
by NASA at about that time for ATS 1 - ATS 6 correlative  studies.  The
spacecraft served as a communications satellite for a number of state, federal,
and public organizations.  It continued to operate at its final longitude of
164 degress East until September 1983, when the spacecraft was moved out of the
geostationary orbit.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">NOAA-9 (ATN series) was launched on December 12, 1984 and was a
third-generation operational meteorological satellite. The satellite
design provided an economical and stable sun-synchronous platform.
This platform enables the satellite to carry advanced operational
instruments to measure the earth's atmosphere, its surface and cloud
cover, and the near-space environment.  The satellite was based upon
the Block 5D spacecraft bus developed for the U.S. Air Force, and was
capable of maintaining an earth-pointing accuracy of better than plus
or minus 0.1 degree with a motion rate of less than 0.035 degree/second.

Primary sensors included (1) an Advanced Very High Resolution
Radiometer (AVHRR), (2) a TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS),
(3) an Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE), and (4) a Solar
Backscatter Ultraviolet Radiometer (SBUV/2).  The secondary experiment
was a Data Collection and Platform Location System (DCPLS). A Search
and Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking (SARSAT) system was also carried
on NOAA-9.

QuikSCAT mission is intended to record sea-surface wind speed and direction data under all weather and cloud conditions over Earth's oceans. QuikSCAT was initiated as a "quick recovery" mission to help reduce the ocean-wind vector data gap created by the loss of the NASA Scatterometer (NSCAT) on the Japanese Advanced Earth Observing Satellite (ADEOS), which ceased functioning when ADEOS failed on June 30, 1997. QuikSCAT was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., aboard a Titan II vehicle, reducing the data gap by about one-half.

QuikSCAT operates in a near polar orbit. It flies in a circular orbit at an altitude of approximately 800 km (500 miles) above Earth's surface. It completes a full orbit in about 101 minutes, which translates to a little more than 14 orbits per day.

SeaWinds is the main instrument on the QuikSCAT satellite. SeaWinds is an active radar scatterometer. This scatterometer operates by transmitting high-frequency microwave pulses to the ocean surface and measuring the echoed radar pulses bounced back to the satellite. The scatterometer estimates wind speed and direction over the Earth's oceans at 10 m above the surface of the water. The instrument collects data over ocean, land, and ice in a continuous, 1,800-kilometer-wide band, making approximately 400,000 measurements and covering 90% of Earth's surface in one day. QuikSCAT can acquire hundreds of times more observations of surface wind velocity each day than can ships and buoys, and can provide continuous, accurate and high-resolution measurements of both wind speeds and direction regardless of weather conditions. This data is vital for global climate research, operational weather forecasting, and storm warning.

The SeaWinds scatterometer is providing unprecedented, frequent surface wind speed and direction measurements over the global oceans. Coupled with other satellite measurements of cloud patterns, water vapor and rain, the data are contributing to scientists' ability to predict the intensity, location and movements of hurricanes and other severe marine weather patterns.

A network of stations that collect rain water samples which are
sent to the Central Chemical Laboratory at Pune for complete

to provide visible and IR day/night cloudcover data and radiances and
(2) disseminate image data to users through the Data Collection
Platform (DCP). MOP-2 (or Meteosat 5) is a 2.1 m diameter, 3.195 m
high stepped cylindrical body with solar cells on six main body
panels. The spacecraft is spin-stabilized at 100 rpm around the main
axis aligned almost parallel to the Earth's axis with spin regulated
by two small hydrazine thrusters. Spin access control and east-west
stationkeeping is provided by two pairs of large thrusters.  Attitude
information is provided by Earth horizon and Sun-lit sensors.  A
radiating dipole antenna directs S-band (333 kbs) transmission of DCP
image data to the Data Acquisition, Telemetry, and Tracking Station at
Odenwald, Germany for relay to the Meteosat Ground Computer System and
Meteosat Operations Control center at ESA's European Space Operations

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">SSTL has developed the BEIJING-1 microsatellite bus for the Beijing Landview Mapping Information Technology Ltd (BLMIT). The BEIJING-1 enhanced microsatellite is an Earth observation spacecraft that combines SSTLs standard Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) multispectral camera with a high resolution panchromatic imager.

The customised microsatellite has specific enhancements to provide accommodation for the two imagers: a 32m multispectral imager currently flown on AlSAT-1, UK-DMC and NigeriaSat-1, plus a new 4m panchromatic imager developed under contract to SIRA Electro-Optics Ltd. The satellite bus provides highly agile attitude control to provide accurate pointing and the knowledge necessary for the mapping requirements of the mission.

BEIJING-1 is supported by SSTL S-band telemetry, telecommand and an 8Mbps data retrieval ground station and is further supported by a customer furnished X-band data retrieval ground station and reflector subsystem.

The Satellite was Launched on October 27th 2005 following a 24-month spacecraft development programme and is presently undergoing in orbit commissioning.

The rocket was launched from Plesetsk Space Center, 800
kilometers northeast of Moscow, and successfully brought the
satellites on board, including OHB?s micro-satellite
RUBIN-4-dsi, into their respective orbits. OHB, via its
subsidiary COSMOS International Satellitenstart GmbH, organized
and carried out the services associated with the launch of South
Korean research satellite KAISTSAT-4, which was also on board.

The orbital telematics experiment Rubin-4-dsi developed by OHG
is located on the upper stage of the COSMOS and transmits
information on the rocket?s acceleration, vibration load and
position. Rubin will transmit this information to earth via
e-mail using the Orbcomm satellite communications system. In
this way, it will be possible to track the rocket in orbit
reliably and without any data loss.

RUBIN-4-dsi is the fourth micro-satellite from the RUBIN series
developed and maintained by OHB. The first was launched in July
2000 and transmitted approximately 1,600 e-mails with measuring
data from outer space. RUBIN-2, a much more complex follow-up
model, and RUBIN-3 came at the end of 2002.

Among other things, RUBIN communications technology can in
future be used for communicating with satellites orbiting close
to the earth without any data loss. Moreover, RUBIN can provide
early information on whether a satellite was successfully put
into orbit.

  Spacecraft Brief Description

  Gemini  8 was the sixth manned earth-orbiting spacecraft of the Gemini
  series.  The primary mission objectives were to perform rendezvous and
  four  docking  tests  with  the Agena target vehicle and to execute an
  extravehicular  activity (EVA) experiment. Ten technological, medical,
  and   scientific  experiments  were  carried  on  board.  Of  the  six
  scientific  experiments  only  the Agena micrometeorite collection was
  successful. the others -- (1) zodiacal light photography, (2) frog egg
  growth,  (3)  synoptic terrain photography, (4) nuclear emulsions, and
  (5)  spectrophotography of clouds -- were incomplete, owing to a large
  loss of fuel and early termination of the mission. The EVA docking and
  other  maneuvers  were  canceled. The spacecraft reentered the earth's
  atmosphere  after  6.5 orbits and landed in the pacific ocean on March
  17, 1966.

between 1960-1972. The images were used to produce maps and
charts for the Department of Defense and other Federal
Government mapping programs.

President Clinton signed an Executive Order on 24 February 1995,
directing the declassification of intelligence imagery acquired
by the first generation of United States photo-reconnaissance
satellites, including the systems code-named CORONA, ARGON and

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Luna 17 was launched from an earth parking orbit towards the Moon and entered lunar orbit on November 15, 1970. The spacecraft soft landed on the Moon in the Sea of Rains. The spacecraft had dual ramps by which the payload, Lunokhod 1, descended to the lunar surface. Lunokhod 1 was a lunar vehicle formed of a tub-like compartment with a large convex lid on eight independently powered wheels. Lunokhod was equipped with a cone-shaped antenna, a highly directional helical antenna, four television cameras, and special extendable devices to impact the lunar soil for soil density and mechanical property tests. An x-ray spectrometer, an x-ray telescope, cosmic-ray detectors, and a laser device were also included. The vehicle was powered by a solar cell array mounted on the underside of the lid. Lunokhod was intended to operate through three lunar days but actually operated for eleven lunar days. The operations of Lunokhod officially ceased on October 4, 1971, the anniversary of Sputnik 1. Lunokhod had traveled 10,540 m and had transmitted more than 20,000 TV pictures and more than 200 TV panoramas. It had also conducted more than 500 lunar soil tests.

[SMAP was launched on 2015-01-31]

The Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) mission has been recommended by the NRC Earth Science Decadal Survey Panel for launch in 2015. SMAP will use a combined radiometer and high-resolution radar to measure surface soil moisture and freeze-thaw state, providing for scientific advances and societal benefits. Direct measurements of soil moisture and freeze/thaw state are needed to improve our understanding of regional water cycles, ecosystem productivity, and processes that link the water, energy, and carbon cycles. Soil moisture information at high resolution enables improvements in weather forecasts, flood and drought forecasts, and predictions of agricultural productivity and climate change.

The National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) Integrated Program Office (IPO) has developed a tri-agency set of requirements for the next generation of polar-orbiting operational environmental satellites. A novel approach combining radar-radiometer and L-band mapping of global soil moisture will allow SMAP to far exceed the NPOESS soil moisture threshold (minimum performance) requirements for sensing depth and spatial resolution. With "fast-track" development, it is possible that SMAP could provide critical gap-filling soil moisture measurements for NPOESS, which were lost when the Conical Microwave Imager/Sounder was cancelled from the first NPOESS platform.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">NOAA-2 was launched in October 1972 and was the first in a series of
reconfigured ITOS satellites launched with new meteorological sensors
onboard to expand the operational capability of the ITOS
system. NOAA-2 was not equipped with conventional TV cameras. It was
the first operational weather satellite to rely solely upon
radiometric imaging to obtain cloudcover data.  The primary objective
was to provide global daytime and nighttime direct readout real-time
cloudcover data on a daily basis. The sun-synchronous spacecraft was
also capable of supplying global atmospheric temperature soundings and
very high resolution infrared cloudcover data for selected areas in
either a direct readout or a tape-recorder mode. A secondary objective
was to obtain global solar-proton flux data on a real-time daily
basis.  The sensors were mounted on the satellite baseplate with their
optical axes directed vertically earthward. The nearly cubical
spacecraft measured 1 by 1 by 1.2 m. The satellite was equipped with
three curved solar panels that were folded during launch and deployed
after orbit was achieved. Each panel measured over 4.2 m in length
when unfolded and was covered with approximately 3500 solar cells
measuring 2 by 2 cm. The dynamics and attitude control system
maintained desired spacecraft orientation through gyroscopic
principles incorporated into the satellite design. Earth orientation
of the satellite body was maintained by taking advantage of the
precession induced from a momentum flywheel so that the satellite body
precession rate of one revolution per orbit provided the desired
'earth-looking' attitude. Minor adjustments in attitude and
orientation were made by means of magnetic coils and by varying the
speed of the momentum flywheel.
The primary sensors consisted of a Very High Resolution Radiometer
(VHRR), Vertical Temperature Profile Radiometer (VTPR), and a Scanning
Radiometer (SR).  The spacecraft operated satisfactorily until March
18, 1974, when the VTPR failed. NOAA-2 was then placed in a marginal
standby mode from March 19 to July 1, 1974. It was then used as the
operational NOAA satellite until October 16, 1974, when it was again
placed in a marginal standby mode. The spacecraft was deactivated on
January 30, 1975.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The T-39 is the Air Force version of Rockwell's popular Sabreliner executive aircraft. This handy twin-jet utility plane has been used for many purposes: a four-passenger executive transport, light priority cargo and for radar and navigational training. The T-39 Sabreliner is a low wing, twin jet aircraft. The cockpit and cabin compartments are pressurized and soundproofed for high altitude flight. Power is supplied by two Pratt and Whitney, J60 gas turbine engines located on each side of the aft fuselage. The rated sea level static thrust of each engine is 3,000 pounds at military power.

The T-39 was developed by North American Aviation Inc. as a private venture to meet a USAF requirement for a twin jet utility trainer. The prototype T-39 made its first flight on September 16, 1958. In January 1959, the USAF placed a production order and on June 30, 1960, the first production T-39A made its initial flight. In all, 143 T-39As and 6 T-39Bs were built for the USAF.

Another 62 T-39 variants were produced for the Navy. In July 1961, the Navy ordered ten of North American’s Model NA-277 to train radar operators. In that order the aircraft was designated T3J-1, but by the time the first one was delivered in 1962, the designation had been changed to T-39D. A total of 52 additional aircraft were accepted. After the bulk of military contracts had been met, the Sabreliner entered the commercial market where it became a highly successful executive jet transport.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Polar spacecraft was launched on February 24, 1996, to obtain data from
both high- and low-altitude perspectives of this active region of geospace.
High above the poles the particles of the solar wind and the energy of the wind
can find their way into the magnetosphere. At lesser altitudes energy is
transferred from electric fields and electromagnetic waves to electrons that
then plunge into the atmosphere to create the aurora. At mid-altitudes nearer
the equator the satellite passes through the Earth's trapped radiation, the Van
Allen belts. Out of the polar ionosphere flows plasma to populate the
magnetosphere. Through this region particles and energy flow from the
geomagnetic tail to the atmosphere. Thus the instruments on the Polar
satellites see a lot of action in the various plasma parameters that they
measure.

Three of the twelve scientific instruments aboard the Polar satellite are used
to image the aurora in various wavelengths when the satellite is near apogee,
high over the northern polar region. The other nine instruments make
measurements in-situ, at the location of the satellite, around the entire
orbit. They measure the fluxes of charged particles, electrons and protons,  as
well as heavier ions, from thermal energies into MeV energies. They measure
magnetic and electric fields, plus electromagnetic waves. They must make these
measurements in great detail in order for scientists to be able to learn new
things about the environment in the region over the poles of the Earth.

The Polar satellite is in a highly elliptical orbit, with apogee at 9 earth
radii and perigee at 1.8 earth radii geocentric. The inclination is 86 deg. and
the period about 18 hours. Initially apogee was over the northern polar region,
but apogee has been moving towards the equator at about 16 deg. per year.  The
nominal mission duration was two years, but a three year extended  mission has
been approved.  

Details on the POLAR mission and instrumentation are provided in Space Science
Reviews (Vol. 71, Nos. 1-4, 1995) and reprinted in The Global Geospace Mission,
edited by C. T. Russell (Kluwer, 1995).

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) spacecraft was the
second of the Applications Explorer Missions (AEM).  This small, versatile,
and relatively low-cost spacecraft was made of two distinct parts:

(1)  The SAGE instrument module containing the detectors
        and the associated hardware, and

(2)  The base module containing the necessary data handling,
        power, communications, command, and the attitude control
        subsystem to support the instruments.

The objective of the SAGE mission was to obtain stratospheric aerosol
and ozone data on a global scale for a better understanding of the earth&amp;#039;s
environmental quality and the radiation budget.  The SAGE spacecraft was
designed for a 1-year life in orbit.  Unfortunately, SAGE experienced
power problems after May 15, 1979.  Nevertheless, spacecraft operations
continued until November 19, 1981.  The signal from the spacecraft was
last received on January 7, 1982 when the battery failed.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The primary objectives of Ulysses, formerly the International Solar Polar Mission (ISPM), are to investigate, as a function of solar latitude, the properties of the solar wind and the interplanetary magnetic field, of galactic cosmic rays and neutral interstellar gas, and to study energetic particle composition and acceleration. The 55 kg payload includes two magnetometers, two solar wind plasma instruments, a unified radio/plasma wave instrument, three energetic charged particle instruments, an interstellar neutral gas sensor, a solar X-ray/cosmic gamma-ray burst detector, and a cosmic dust sensor. The communications systems is also used to study the solar corona and to search for gravitational waves. Secondary objectives included interplanetary and planetary physics investigations during the initial Earth-Jupiter phase and investigations in the Jovian magnetosphere. The spacecraft used a Jupiter swingby in Feb. 1992 to transfer to a heliospheric orbit with high heliocentric inclination, and will pass over the rotational south pole of the sun in mid-1994 at 2 AU, and over the north pole in mid-1995. A second solar orbit will take Ulysses again over the south and north poles in years 2000 and 2001, respectively. The spacecraft is powered by a single radio-isotope generator. It is spin stabilized at a rate of 5 rpm and its high-gain antenna points continuously to the earth.

DMSP 5D-2/F11 is one of a series of meteorological satellites developed and operated by the Air Force under the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). This program, previously known as DAPP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objective of this program is to provide global visual and infrared cloudcover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense operational weather analysis and forecasting requirements. Operationally, the program consists of two satellites in sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other at local noon. The 6.4-m-long spacecraft is separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform for sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment; (2) an equipment support module containing the electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors; (3) a reaction control equipment support structure containing the third-stage rocket motor and supporting the ascent phase reaction control equipment; and (4) a 9.29-sq-m solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization is controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system so that sensors are maintained in the desired earth-looking mode. One feature is the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allows automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element. The operational linescan system is the primary data acquisition system that provides real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night, visual and infrared imagery of clouds. A supplementary sensor package contains five special sensors: (1) a microwave temperature sounder, (2) an X-ray spectrometer, (3) an ionospheric/scintillation monitor, (4) a precipitating electron/ion spectrometer, and (5) a microwave imager. Either recorded or real-time data are transmitted to ground-receiving sites by two redundant S-band transmitters. Recorded data are read out to tracking sites located at Fairchild AFB, Washington, and at Loring AFB, Maine, and relayed by SATCOM to Air Force Global Weather Central, Offutt AFB, Nebraska. Real-time data are read out at mobile tactical sites located around the world. Additional information concerning this satellite can be found in the report by D. A. Nichols, "The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program," Optical Engineering, v. 14, n. 4, p. 273, July-August 1975.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">AEROSONDE:

Small robotic aircraft for long-range environmental monitoring
and surveillance.  It has been developed especially for
meteorological and environmental reconnaissance over oceanic and
remote areas and in harsh conditions, for which its economy and
flexibility will allow routine operations on a much wider scale
than has been possible in the past. It has been extended to
surveillance and other reconnaissance applications.

The Aerosonde is being deployed to fill chronic gaps in the
global upper-air sounding network, to conduct systematic
surveillance of tropical cyclones and other severe weather, to
undertake offshore surveillance and agricultural/biological
surveys, and to obtain specialist observations, such as volcanic
plumes.

Miniaturisation and flexibility, fully robotic operation and
remote command are the key factors in the Aerosonde success. We
have proven that an aircraft weighing less than 15 kg can
undertake completely autonomous missions of several thousand
kilometres and several days duration.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">EQUATOR-S  is a low-cost mission designed to study the Earth's equatorial
magnetosphere out to distances of 67000 km and it forms an element of the
closely-coordinated fleet of satellites that comprise the  IASTP  program
(http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/istp/sci_operations/www-sites.html) . It is
based on a simple spacecraft design and carries a science payload consisting of
advanced instruments that were developed for other IASTP missions. Unique
features of  EQUATOR-S  are its nearly equatorial orbit and its high spin rate.
It was launched as an auxiliary payload on an Ariane-4 on December 2nd, 1997.
The mission is intended for a two-year lifetime.

The idea of an equatorial satellite dates back to NASA's GGS (Global Geospace
Science) program originally conceived in 1980. When the equatorial element of
the program was abandoned in 1986 and several subsequent attempts to rescue the
mission had failed, the Max-Planck-Institut f?r extraterrestrische Physik (MPE)
decided in 1991 to fill this gap in the GGS (and in the international IASTP)
program because of its interest in the global magnetospheric science, and
because it provided an opportunity for a test of an advanced instrument, EDI,
to measure electric fields with dual electron beams. The realization of
EQUATOR-S was possible through a grant from the German Space Agency DARA
(meanwhile part of DLR), that was approved in late 1994, but also through
MPE-internal funds and personnel.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The ER-2 is a civilian version of the Air Force's U2-S reconnaissance platform. These high-altitude aircraft are used as platforms for investigations that cannot be accomplished by sensor platforms of the private sector. Aircraft and spacecraft have proven to be excellent platforms for remote and in situ sensing. The ER-2, flying at the edge of space, can scan shorelines, measure water levels, help fight forest fires, profile the atmosphere, assess flood damage, and sample the stratosphere.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Atmospheric Explorer-E (AE-E) spacecraft (Designation: 08440 /
75107A) was designed as a multi- sided polyhedron shaped frame with a
mean diameter of 1.4 meters.  AE-E was similar in construction and
instrumentation to AE-C. AE-E was launched on 1975-11-20 and decayed
on 1981-06-10.

The purpose of the AE-C mission was to investigate the uppermost layer
of the earth's atmosphere, the thermosphere, with emphasis on energy
transfer and other controlling processes.  Photochemical processes
related to the absorption of solar UV radiation were studied by making
coordinated measurements of reacting constituents and the solar input.
Simultaneous two-spacecraft sampling was carried out at higher
latitudes by the AE-D and AE-E spacecraft until the failure of AE-D on
January 29, 1976, and then by (the re-activated) AE-C and AE-E
spacecraft until AE-C re-entered the earth's atmosphere on December
12, 1978.

The AE-E perigee swept through more than six full latitude cycles and
two local time cycles during the first year after launch when the
orbit was elliptical, and the perigee height was varied between 130
and 400 km.  The circularization of the orbit around 390 km was made
on November 20, 1976, and the spacecraft perigee was raised to this
height whenever it had decayed to about 250 km.  AE-E re-entered the
earth's atmosphere on June 10, 1981 thus terminating the operations.
The payload included instrumentation to measure: Solar UV Fluxes, the
Composition of Positive Ions and Neutral Particles, the Density and
Temperature of neutral particles, positive ions and electrons,
Atmospheric airglow emissions, Photoelectron Energy Spectra, Proton
and Electron Fluxes with particle energy up to 25 keV, and a
backscatter UV spectrometer to monitor the atmospheric ozone content.
Power was supplied by a solar cell array.  The spacecraft used a PCM
telemetry data system that operated in real time or using a tape
recorder.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Russian space station MIR was launched in 1986, providing opportunities in many scientific areas.  Planning for an environmental remote sensing module began in the mid-1980's which was later called PRIRODA (Russian for "Nature"). The PRIRODA module was launched from Baykonur Cosmodrome, Kazakhstan aboard a Proton-K rocket on April 23, 1996.  The PRIRODA module docked with the MIR space station on April 26, 1996. The PRIRODA module consists of a passive microwave package (IKAR) consisting of 3 instuments: IKAR-N, IKAR-D, and IKAR-P; an active microwave Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR); and the following optical instruments: an infrared ISTOK-1 from Russia, Czechia, MOS-A and MOSD-B imaging radiometers from Germany, MOMS-2P high resolution multispectral ans stereo scanner from Germany, MSU-SK and MSU-E multispectral scanners from Russia, a TV-camera, and an OZONE-M ozone profiler. The PRIRODA mission is conducted by the Russian Space Agency (RKA), the Institute for Radioelectronics of the Russian Acadamy of Sciences, and RKK ENERGIA.  International participants include Belorussia, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Russia, Switzerland, Ukraine, and USA.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Atmospheric Explorer-C (AE-C) spacecraft (designation: 06977 /
73101A ) was designed as a multi- sided polyhedron shaped frame with a
mean diameter of 1.4 meter.  AE-C weighed about 660 kg which included
85 kg of scientific instrumentation. AE-C was launched on 1973-12-16
and decayed on 1978-12-12.

The purpose of the AE-C mission was to investigate the uppermost layer
of the earth's atmosphere, the thermosphere, with emphasis on energy
transfer and other controlling processes.  Photochemical processes
related to the absorption of solar UV radiation were studied by making
coordinated measurements of reacting constituents and the solar input.
The payload included instrumentation to measure: Solar UV Fluxes, the
Composition of Positive Ions and Neutral Particles, the Density and
Temperature of neutral particles, positive ions and electrons,
Atmospheric airglow emissions, Photoelectron Energy Spectra, and
Proton and Electron Fluxes with particle energy up to 25 keV.
The initial elliptical orbit of AE-C was altered many times in the
first year of operations by means of an onboard propulsion system
employing a 3.5-lb thruster.

PERIGEE CHANGES: The purpose of these changes was first to alter the
perigee height to 129 km.  Later the AE-C orbit was circularized and
the perigee height was raised periodically, eventually to about 390 km
height.  By the natural drag action of the exosphere the orbit was
then let to decay to 250 km perigee altitude.

LATITUDE COVERAGE: During the first year, the latitude of perigee
moved from about 10 degrees north up to 68 degrees north and then down
to about 60 degrees south.

LOCAL TIME COVERAGE: During this period of orbit modification about
two cycles through all local times were completed.

OPERATIONAL MODES: The spacecraft could be operated in either of two
modes: spinning at a nominal 4 rpm or despun to 1 revolution per
orbit.  The spin axis was perpendicular to the orbit plane.
Power was supplied by a solar cell array.  The spacecraft used a PCM
telemetry data system that operated in real time or using an onboard
tape recorder.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Landsat 1, originally named Earth Resources Technology Satellite 1, was a
modified version of the Nimbus 4 meteorological satellite. It was launched on
July 23, 1972, the first satellite of the United States&amp;#039; Landsat program. The
near-polar orbiting spacecraft served as a stabilized, Earth-oriented platform
for obtaining information on agricultural and forestry resources, geology and
mineral resources, hydrology and water resources, geography, cartography,
environmental pollution, oceanography and marine resources, and meteorological
phenomena.

To accomplish these objectives, the spacecraft was equipped with (1) a
three-camera return beam vidicon (RBV) to obtain visible light and near
infrared photographic images of Earth, (2) a four-channel multispectral scanner
(MSS) to obtain radiometric images of Earth, and (3) a data collection system
(DCS) to collect information from remote, individually equipped ground stations
and to relay the data to central acquisition stations. Landsat 1 carried two
wide-band video tape recorders (WBVTR) capable of storing up to 30 min of
scanner or camera data to give the spacecraft&amp;#039;s sensors a near-global coverage
capability.

An advanced attitude control system consisting of horizon scanners, sun
sensors, and a command antenna combined with a freon gas propulsion system
permitted the spacecraft&amp;#039;s orientation to be maintained within plus or minus
0.7 degrees in all three axes. Spacecraft communications included a command
subsystem operating at 154.2 and 2106.4 MHz and a PCM narrow-band telemetry
subsystem, operating at 2287.5 and 137.86 MHz, for spacecraft housekeeping,
attitude, and sensor performance data. Video data from the three-camera RBV
system was transmitted in both real-time and tape recorder modes at 2265.5 MHz,
while information from the MSS was constrained to a 20 MHz rf bandwidth at
2229.5 MHz.

In 1976, Landsat 1 discovered a tiny uninhabited island 20 km off the eastern
coast of Canada. This island was thereafter designated Landsat Island after the
satellite. As of 2006, it is the only island to be discovered via satellite
imagery.

The spacecraft was turned off on January 6, 1978, when cumulative precession of
the orbital plane caused the spacecraft to see almost constant sunlight which
led to overheating.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">VENERA Mission Description:

Venera 13 and 14 were identical spacecraft built to take
advantage of the 1981 Venus launch opportunity and launched 5
days apart. The Venera 13 mission consisted of a bus (81-106A)
and an attached descent craft (81-106D). The Venera 13 descent
craft/lander was a hermetically sealed pressure vessel, which
contained most of the instrumentation and electronics, mounted
on a ring-shaped landing platform and topped by an antenna. The
design was similar to the earlier Venera 9-12 landers. It
carried instruments to take chemical and isotopic measurements,
monitor the spectrum of scattered sunlight, and record electric
discharges during its descent phase through the Venusian
atmosphere. The spacecraft utilized a camera system, an X-ray
fluorescence spectrometer, a screw drill and surface sampler, a
dynamic penetrometer, and a seismometer to conduct
investigations on the surface.  After launch and a four month
cruise to Venus, the descent vehicle separated from the bus and
plunged into the Venus atmosphere on 1 March 1982. After
entering the atmosphere a parachute was deployed. At an altitude
of 47 km the parachute was released and simple airbraking was
used the rest of the way to the surface. Venera 13 landed about
950 km northeast of Venera 14 at 7 deg 30 min S, 303 E, just
east of the eastern extension of an elevated region known as
Phoebe Regio. The area was composed of bedrock outcrops
surrounded by dark, fine-grained soil. After landing an imaging
panorama was started and a mechanical drilling arm reached to
the surface and obtained a sample, which was deposited in a
hermetically sealed chamber, maintained at 30 degrees C and a
pressure of about .05 atmospheres. The composition of the sample
determined by the X-ray flourescence spectrometer put it in the
class of weakly differentiated melanocratic alkaline
gabbroids. The lander survived for 127 !  minutes (the planned
design life was 32 minutes) in an environment with a temperature
of 457 degrees C and a pressure of 84 Earth atmospheres. The
descent vehicle transmitted data to the bus, which acted as a
data relay as it flew by Venus.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The first dedicated mission with acquisition of science data as its primary objective, Spacelab 3 was a multidisciplinary mission emphasizing investigations requiring the low-gravity environment of Earth orbit. The experiments covered several disciplines. For the materials processing discipline, higher-quality crystals were grown by two methods; namely, seed crystal growth in a saturated solution and condensation from the vapor phase. The two fluid physics experiments studied the dynamic behavior of rotating and oscillating liquid drops, and the convection processes found in planetary atmospheres and in stellar interiors. The performance of equipment and facilities specially designed for investigations on the Spacelab Life Sciences mission series was evaluated. The investigations selected for the Spacelab 3 mission originated in the United States, France, and India, and represented a total of five different disciplines, including material science, life sciences, fluid mechanics, atmospheric science, and astronomy. Two of the investigations, one in material science and one in astronomy, had already flown aboard Spacelab 1. Many of the Spacelab 3 investigations were scheduled to be modified and reflown on later missions to further explore the discoveries of this mission. Some of the experiments were located in the module, some on the pallet in the payload bay, and one at middeck. Spacelab 3 consisted of a Spacelab long module and a pallet. The mission successfully demonstrated the capability of Spacelab for multidiscipline research in microgravity.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">OGO 2 was a large observatory instrumented with 20 experiments designed to make simultaneous, correlative observations of aurora and airglow emissions, energetic particles, magnetic field variations, ionospheric properties, etc., especially over the polar areas. OGO 2 consisted of a main body, generally parallelepipedal in form, two rectangular solar panels, each with a solar-oriented experiment package (SOEP), and two orbital plane experiment packages (OPEP). It also included six experiment packages (EP-1,-2,-3,-4,-5, and -6) mounted on booms extending generally fore and aft of the spacecraft along the Y axis. Antenna and attitude control fixtures also extended from separate and/or EP booms. The main body was attitude-controlled by use of horizon scanners and gas jets and was designed to point toward the earth (Z axis). The axis connecting the two solar panels (X axis) was designed to oscillate in order to remain perpendicular to the earth-sun-spacecraft plane. The solar panels activated by sun sensors could rotate about this X axis in order to obtain maximum radiation for the solar cells and concurrently orient the SOEP properly. The OPEPs were reoriented on either end of an axis that was parallel to the Z axis and attached to the forward end of the main body. These OPEP sensors normally were maintained looking forward in the orbital plane of the satellite. To maintain this orientation, the OPEP axis could rotate over 90 deg. In addition, an angular difference of over 90 deg was possible between the orientation of the upper and lower OPEP packages. The SOEP contained four experiments, and the OPEP contained five experiments. Soon after achieving orbit, difficulties in maintaining earth lock with horizon scanners caused exhaustion of attitude control gas by October 23, 1965, 10 days after launch. At this time, the spacecraft entered a spin mode (about 0.11 rpm) with a large coning angle about the previously vertical axis. Five experiments became useless when the satellite went into this spin mode. Six additional experiments were degraded by this loss of attitude control. By April 1966, both batteries had failed, so subsequent observations were limited to sunlit portions of the orbit. By December 1966, only eight experiments were operational, five of which were not degraded by the spin mode operation. By April 1967, the tape recorders had malfunctioned and only one third of the recorded data could be processed. Spacecraft power and periods of operational scheduling conflicts created six large data gaps so that data were observed on a total of about 306 days of the 2-yr, 18-day total span of observed satellite data to November 1, 1967. The data gaps were (a) October 24, 1965, to November 5, 1965, (b) December 6, 1965, to January 7, 1966, (c) April 9, 1966, to June 21, 1966, (d) September 2, 1966, to November 18, 1966, (e) December 27, 1966, to April 11, 1967, and (f) May 9, 1967, to September 19, 1967. The spacecraft was shut down on November 1, 1967, with eight experiments still operational. It was reactivated for 2 weeks in February 1968 to operate experiment 65-081A-05.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The aim of the Cluster mission is to study small-scale structures of the
magnetosphere and its environment in three dimensions. To achieve this, Cluster
is constituted of four identical spacecraft that will flight in a tetrahedral
configuration. The separation distances between the spacecraft will be varied
between 600 km and 20 000 km, according to the key scientific regions. 

The first Cluster mission was launched on 4 June 1996, but the launch vehicle 
exploded 37 seconds into the flight.

Cluster II was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on 16 July 2000
and 9 August 2000. The four satellites were put into orbit, in pairs, by two
Soyuz rockets provided by the Russian-French Starsem company. Starsem has four
shareholders - Aerospatiale, Arianespace, the Russian Space Agency and TsSKB
Samara, the manufacturer of the Soyuz vehicle. 

Each of the four spacecraft carries an identical set of 11 instruments to
investigate charged particles, electrical and magnetic fields. These were built
by European and American instrument teams led by Principal Investigators.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Explorer 32 was an aeronomy satellite which was designed to directly measure temperatures, composition, densities, and pressures in the upper atmosphere on a global basis.  The satellite was a stainless steel, vacuum-sealed sphere, 0.889 m in diameter.  The experimental payload included one ion and two neutral mass spectrometers, three magnetron density gauges, and two electrostatic probes.  Additional equipment included optical and magnetic aspect sensors, magnetic attitude and spin rate control systems, and a tape recorder for data acquisition at locations remote from ground receiving stations.  Power was supplied by silver-zinc batteries and a solar cell array mounted on the satellite exterior.  Two identical pulse-modulated telemetry systems and a canted turnstile antenna were employed.  The two neutral-particle mass spectrometers failed about 6 days after launch. The remaining experiments operated satisfactorily and provided useful data for most of the 10-month satellite lifetime.  The spacecraft ceased to function due to battery failures which resulted from depressurization of the sphere.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (or TRMM) is a NASA satellite that provides more information both to test and to improve those models. TRMM is particularly devoted to determining rainfall in the tropics and subtropics of the Earth. These regions make up about two thirds of the total rainfall on Earth and are responsible for driving our weather and climate system. TRMM contributed to a better understanding of where and how much the winds blow, where the clouds form and rain occurs, where floods and droughts will occur, and how the winds drive the ocean currents. TRMM accomplished this not just by providing rainfall data but, more importantly, by providing information on heat released into the atmosphere as part of the process that leads to rain.

TRMM was launched on November 27, 1997, on the Japanese H-II vehicle from the Tanegashima Space Center in Tanegashima, Japan. Continuous science data collection began December 8, 1997. Upon completion of the nominal 3-year prime mission, the decision was made to boost the mission from its original altitude of 350km to 402.5km, to reduce fuel consumption and extend the mission life. The TRMM boost was completed August 24, 2001, and the orbit was maintained until 2014, when fuel was depleted and the spacecraft began to descend. Mission operations were terminated in April 2015, the spacecraft re-entered the Earth’s atmosphere and mostly burned up in June 2015.

TRMM exceeded its 3-year design goal by collecting 17 years of rainfall data, creating a benchmark rainfall climatology which is used to test, compare and improve global climate models. The TRMM dataset of rain distribution across the tropics has narrowed considerably the range of uncertainty in previous space-based rainfall estimates. The choice of a precessing, low-inclination orbit (35°) enabled the quantification of the diurnal cycle of precipitation and convective intensity over land and ocean tropics-wide on fine scales (0.25°). TRMM products have provided the first comprehensive estimates of how rainfall is directly related to latent heat release in the atmosphere, a key characteristic in understanding the impact of tropical rainfall on the general circulation of the atmosphere. Based on hydrometeor vertical structure information from the TRMM active and passive sensors, TRMM produced climatologies of latent heating profiles for analysis and comparison with global models. In addition, the lightning sensor delivered a detailed global map of lightning distribution, and combined with the rain data, led to quantifying the lightning/convection relation for land and ocean.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Nimbus 7 research-and-development satellite served as a
stabilized, earth-oriented platform for the testing of advanced
systems for sensing and collecting data in the pollution,
oceanographic and meteorological disciplines.  The polar-orbiting
spacecraft consisted of three major structures: (1) a hollow
torus-shaped sensor mount, (2) solar paddles, and (3) a control
housing unit that was connected to the sensor mount by a tripod truss
structure.  Configured somewhat like an ocean buoy, Nimbus-7 was
nearly 3.04 m tall, 1.52 m in diameter at the base, and about 3.96 m
wide with solar paddles extended.  The sensor mount that formed the
satellite base housed the electronics equipment and battery modules.
The lower surface of the torus provided mounting space for sensors and
antennas.  A box-beam structure mounted within the center of the torus
provided support for the larger sensor experiments.  Mounted on the
control housing unit, which was located on top of the spacecraft, were
sun sensors, horizon scanners, and a command antenna.  The spacecraft
spin axis was pointed at the earth.  An advanced attitude-control
system permitted the spacecraft's orientation to be controlled to
within plus or minus 1 deg in all three axes (pitch, roll, and yaw).
Eight experiments were selected: (1) Limb Infrared Monitoring of the
Stratosphere (LIMS), (2) Stratospheric And Mesopheric Sounder (SAMS),
(3) Coastal-Zone Color Scanner (CZCS), (4) Stratospheric Aerosol
Measurement II (SAM II), (5) Earth Radiation Budget (ERB), (6)
Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR), (7) Solar
Backscatter UV and Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (SBUV/TOMS), and
(8) Temperature-Humidity Infrared Radiometer (THIR).  These sensors
were capable of observing several parameters at and below the
mesospheric levels.  The Nimbus-7 spacecraft was turned off in 1994
after 16 years of service.

GOSAT (Greenhouse gases Observing Satellite) is a JAXA (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) mission within the GCOM (Global Change Observation Mission) program of Japan. The GOSAT mission goals call for the study of the transport mechanisms of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4).

The emphasis is on atmospheric monitoring to clarify the sources and sinks of CO2 on a sub-continental scale. The overall mission objective is to contribute to environmental administration by estimating the Green House Gases (GHGs) source and sink on a sub-continental scale and to support the Kyoto protocol that was adsorbed at COP3/UNFCCC (3rd session of the conference in the framework of climate change) in 1997. The protocol calls for a reduction of greenhouse gases, in particular CO2; it requires all parties to reduce their emissions by 5% below the level of the year 1990, for the period of 2008-2012

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">[Source: ESA CryoSat home page, http://www.esa.int/esaLP/ESAOMH1VMOC_LPcryosat_0.html ]
 
ESA’s Earth Explorer CryoSat mission, launched on 8 April 2010, is dedicated to precise monitoring of the changes in the thickness of marine ice floating in the polar oceans and variations in the thickness of the vast ice sheets that overlie Greenland and Antarctica.
 
With the effects of a changing climate fast becoming apparent, particularly in the polar regions, it is increasingly important to understand exactly how Earth’s ice fields are responding. Diminishing ice cover is frequently cited as an early casualty of global warming and since ice, in turn, plays an important role regulating climate and sea level, the consequences of change are far reaching.

For some years now, satellites such as ESA’s Envisat have been mapping the extent of ice cover. As stated in the Climate Change 2007 Synthesis Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, “Satellite data since 1978 show that annual average Arctic sea-ice extent has shrunk by 2.7% per decade.” However, this is only part of the picture.  
	
In order to understand fully how climate change is affecting these remote but sensitive regions, there remains an urgent need to determine exactly how the thickness of the ice, both on land and floating in the sea, is changing. By addressing this challenge, the data delivered by the CryoSat mission will complete the picture and lead to a better understanding of the role ice plays in the Earth system. 

The CryoSat-2 satellite replaces the original CryoSat, which was lost owing to a launch failure in October 2005. Following the loss, the mission was judged to be even more important than when it was first selected for development, and the decision to rebuild was taken. Almost exactly four years to the day after that decision, the new CryoSat-2, with a number of improvements, was ready for launch.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">CartoSat-2A is a follow-up optical imaging mission of CartoSat-2 (launch Jan. 10, 2007), representing India's first dedicated military satellite (funding by the Ministry of Defense of the Government of India). The overall objective is to provide scene-specific spot imagery in high resolution to the Indian Armed Forces - which is in the process of establishing an Aerospace Command.

The spacecraft and its payload, built by ISRO, is practically an identical copy of the CartoSat-2 spacecraft of ISRO. It features a lightweight and compact bus structure using the BMU (Bus Management Unit) for integrated bus functions (of the AOCS, TT&amp;C, etc.). The spacecraft is 3-axis stabilized using high torque reaction wheels, magnetic torquers, and hydrazine thrusters. Attitude sensing is provided by a high performance star sensor and by an improved IRU (Inertial Reference Unit). The satellite is very agile providing a body-pointing capability in along-track and cross-track of up to ±45º (this supports a revisit capability of certain target regions within 4 days). Also use of the SPS (Satellite Positioning System), an 8-channel GPS receiver (C/A code) on-board for the provision of instantaneous state vectors (state vector using pseudo range and range rate measurements) for the spacecraft.

The fixed solar arrays (triple-junction solar cells) provide a power of 900 W when pointed toward the sun; two NiCd batteries of 18 Ah capacity are being used for ecliptic phase bridging.

CartoSat-2A has a launch mass of 690 kg and a design life of 5 years. 

Launch: The launch of CartoSat-2A took place on April 28, 2008 on a PSLV launcher. The launch was conducted from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) SHAR, Sriharikota space station in southern India. Next to the primary payload of CartoSat-2A, the PSLV-C9 vehicle successfully launched the IMS-1 (Indian Microsatellite-1) of 83 kg and eight nanosatellites for international customers.

Sensor complement:

PAN Camera (Panchromatic Camera). The objective is to provide imagery for cartographic applications. The optical system is designed with two mirror Ritchey-Chretien on-axis obscured reflective telescope system with a concave hyperboloidal primary mirror and convex hyperboloid secondary mirrors and the field correcting relay optics. The mirrors are made of special Zerodur glass and are light-weighted to about 60% as in CartoSat-1 series. The mirrors are mounted inside the telescope cylinder made of CFRP with special MFDs (Mirror Fixation Devices) and the whole telescope assembly is mounted to the spacecraft structure through a special suspension arrangement. The optical system is designed to provide &lt; 1 m resolution across track. The along track GSD of &lt; 1 m is achieved by apparent velocity reduction by a factor of 2.5.

The spacecraft can be suitably biased to provide various modes of imaging:

1) Continuous strip monoscopic mode

2) Spot scene imaging (strips on either side of the ground track can be imaged)

3) Paint brush mode of imaging. This mode is used to increase the total swath. Both roll tilt and pitch tilt is employed.

The PAN Camera is a nadir-pointing pushbroom CCD instrument (detector line array of 12, 288 pixels), observing in the visible spectral range of 0.5-0.85 µm with a GSD (Ground Sample Distance) of &lt; 1 m, and a swath width of 9.6 km at nadir. 

The spacecraft is being monitored and controlled from the ISRO mission control center in Bangalore, India using the ISTRAC network of stations at Bangalore, Lucknow, Mauritius, Bearslake in Russia, Biak in Indonesia and Svalbard in Norway.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The most important signal to be recorded at the Superconducting Gravimeter Observatory is gravity. For most Global Geodynamics Project (GGP) purposes the atmospheric correction to gravity is required and so the local measurement of pressure is also necessary. At most sites the effect of groundwater, often associated with rainfall, is an important contributor to gravity variations over periods of days to years. Superconducting Gravimeter  groups are therefore urged to record rainfall and groundwater level at their sites as auxiliary data. Finally each station is asked to supply a log file of important events that might affect the data for each month.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Grumman developed the Gulfstream I turbine powered executive transport to replace the many hundred war surplus piston twins performing such missions in the mid 1950s.

Design work began in 1956, with first flight of the Gulfstream I prototype occurring on August 14 1958. FAA Type certification was awarded on May 21 1959 and deliveries of production aircraft followed from that June. Notably, the Gulfstream I was the first US twin engined corporate transport to be certificated to cruise at 30,000ft.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">A photosynthesis chamber is a transparent airtight enclosure that is used along with a gas exchange system and sensing devices to measure plant functions, such as photosynthetic respiration, stomatal conductance, canopy resistance, and leaf photosynthetic rate, especially in response to changes in light and carbon dioxide concentrations. Photosynthesis chambers can be equipped with environmental control equipment (which allow researchers to vary such things as light, temperature, relative humidity, and gas concentrations).

Photosynthesis chambers provide a controlled environment that supports the study of leaf and plant functions. The specific objectives of a photosynthesis chamber vary according to the needs of the particular study.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">NASA's Thermosphere, Ionosphere, Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED)
spacecraft was launched on December 7, 2001 from Vandenberg AFB. The spacecraft
was built by The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) and
shares the same launch vehicle as NASA's Jason-1 spacecraft.

TIMED is the first mission in NASA's Solar Terrestrial Probes Program and will
study the influences of the sun and humans on the mesosphere and Lower
Thermosphere/Ionosphere (MLTI). TIMED will focus on a portion of the atmosphere
between 60-180 km above the surface.

TIMED's payload consists of four instruments:

- Global Ultraviolet Imager (GUVI): a spatial scanning ultraviolet spectrograph
designed to measure the composition and temperature profiles of the MLTI
region, as well as its auroral energy inputs.

- Solar Extreme Ultraviolet Experiment (SEE): comprised of a spectrometer and a
suite of photometers designed to measure the solar soft X-ray, extreme
ultraviolet and far-ultraviolet radiation in the MLTI region.

- TIMED Doppler Interferometer (TIDI): designed to measure the wind and
temperature profiles of the MLTI region.

- Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER):
designed to measure the pressure, temperature, key gases in the oxygen and
hydrogen families, infrared cooling, and effects of solar and chemical heating
of the MLTI region.

TIMED is sponsored by NASA's Office of Space Science and is managed by NASA's
Goddard Space Flight Center's Solar Terrestrial Probes program Office. The
Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory operates the spacecraft and leads the
science effort.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Atlantis, the fourth orbiter to become operational at Kennedy  Space Center, was named after the primary research vessel for  the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts from  1930 to 1966. The spaceship Atlantis has carried on the spirit  of the sailing vessel with several important voyages of its own,  including the Galileo planetary explorer mission in 1989 and the  deployment of the Arthur Holley Compton Gamma Ray Observatory in  1991.

Atlantis benefited from lessons learned in the construction and  testing of Enterprise, Columbia and Challenger. At rollout, its  weight was some 6,974 pounds less than Columbia. The Experience  gained during the Orbiter assembly process also enabled  Atlantis to be completed with a 49.5 percent reduction in man  hours (compared to Columbia). Much of this decrease can be  attributed to the greater use of thermal protection blankets on  the upper orbiter body instead of tiles. During the  construction of Discovery and Atlantis, NASA opted to have the  various contractors manufacture a set of 'structural spares' to  facilitate the repair of an Orbiter if one was damaged during  an accident. This contract was valued at &amp;#36389 million  and consisted of a spare aft-fuselage, mid-fuselage, forward  fuselage halves, vertical tail and rudder, wings, elevons and a  body flap. These spares were later assembled into the orbiter  Endeavour. Atlantis was shipped to California to undergo  upgrades and modifications. These modifications include a drag  chute, new plumbing lines that configure the orbiter for  extended duration, more than 800 new heat protection tiles and  blankets and new insulation for the main landing gear.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Landsat 2 is the second satellite of the Landsat program. The spacecraft
originally carried a designation of ERTS-B (Earth Resource Technology Satellite
B) but was renamed &amp;Landsat 2&amp; prior to its launch on January 22, 1975. Despite
having a design life of one year, Landsat 2 operated for over seven years,
finally ceasing operations on February 25, 1982.

As in the case of its predecessor Landsat 1, the satellite&amp;#039;s payload included
two remote sensing instruments, the Return Beam Vidicon (RBV) and the
Multi-Spectral Scanner (MSS). The specifications for these instruments were
identical to those of the instruments carried on Landsat 1. (This was not the
case for Landsat 3, which added a short-lived thermal band to the MSS
instrument.) The data acquired by the MSS was considered more scientifically
useful than the data returned from the RBV, which was rarely used and
considered only for engineering evaluation purposes.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Pioneer Venus Orbiter was inserted into an elliptical orbit around Venus on
December 4, 1978. The Orbiter was a flat cylinder 2.5 m in diameter and 1.2 m
high. All instruments and spacecraft subsystems were mounted on the forward end
of the cylinder, except the magnetometer, which was at the end of a 4.7 m boom.
A solar array extended around the circumference of the cylinder. A 1.09 m
despun dish antenna provided S and X band communication with Earth.

The Pioneer Venus Orbiter carried 17 experiments (with a total mass of 45 kg):

    * a cloud photopolarimeter to measure the vertical distribution of the
clouds
    * a surface radar mapper to determine topography and surface
characteristics
    * an infrared radiometer to measure IR emissions from the Venus atmosphere
    * an airglow ultraviolet spectrometer to measure scattered and emitted UV
light
    * a neutral mass spectrometer to determine the composition of the upper
atmosphere
    * a solar wind plasma analyzer to measure properties of the solar wind
    * a magnetometer to characterize the magnetic field at Venus
    * an electric field detector to study the solar wind and its interactions
    * an electron temperature probe to study the thermal properties of the
ionosphere
    * an ion mass spectrometer to characterize the ionospheric ion population
    * a charged particle retarding potential analyzer to study ionospheric
particles
    * two radio science experiments to determine the gravity field of Venus
    * a radio occultation experiment to characterize the atmosphere
    * an atmospheric drag experiment to study the upper atmosphere
    * a radio science atmospheric and solar wind turbulence experiment
    * a gamma ray burst detector to record gamma ray burst events 

From Venus orbit insertion to July 1980, periapsis was held between 142 and 253
km (at 17 degrees north latitude) to facilitate radar and ionospheric
measurements. The spacecraft was in a 24 hour orbit with an apoapsis of 66,900
km. Thereafter, the periapsis was allowed to rise (to 2290 km at maximum) and
then fall, to conserve fuel. In 1991 the Radar Mapper was reactivated to
investigate previously inaccessible southern portions of the planet. In May
1992 Pioneer Venus began the final phase of its mission, in which the periapsis
was held between 150 and 250 km until the fuel ran out and atmospheric entry
destroyed the spacecraft the following August.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The second European Remote Sensing Satellite ERS-2, launched on 20
April 1995, operates in a sun-synchronous, near-polar orbit at an
altitude of 785 km and an inclination of 98.5 degrees ,known as the
reference orbit. The mission consists of an only phase (phase A),
using a 35 day repeat cycle, from 21 April 1995 to the present.

ERS-2 is almost identical to the European Remote Sensing Satellite
ERS-1 launched in 1991.  ERS-2 is capable of measuring, on a global
scale, the Earth's atmospheric and surface properties with a high
degree of accuracy. In fact it uses advanced microwave techniques to
collect global measurements and images (much of the data are collected
from remote areas such as the southern oceans and the Antarctic)
independent of time of day and weather conditions. It also undertakes
the measurements of many parameters not covered by existing satellite
systems, including those of sea state, sea surface winds, ocean
circulation and sea and ice levels.

ERS-2 carries on-board a number of instruments consisting of a core
set of active microwave sensors supported by additional, complementary
instruments: the Active Microwave Instrument (AMI), which combines a
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) operating in image or wave mode and a
wind scatterometer, the Radar Altimeter (RA), the Along-Track Scanning
Radiometer and Microwave Sounder (ATSR-2), the Precise Range and
Range-rate Equipment (PRARE), the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment
(GOME), and Laser Retroreflectors (LRR).

The primary objectives of the ERS-2 mission are the monitoring of the
oceans and sea ice providing essential data for:

- improved representation of oceans/atmosphere interactions
in climatic models
- major advances in the knowledge of ocean circulation and
transfer of energy
- more reliable estimates of the mass balance of the Arctic
and Antarctic ice sheets
- better monitoring of pollution and dynamic coastal
processes
- improved detection and management of land use change.

The capability of ERS-2 to acquire vast global data sets of ocean,
atmosphere, ice and land phenomena contributes to the following types
of study and application:

- Ocean/Ice: ocean circulation, global wind/wave
relationships, sea ice and iceberg monitoring, etc.
- Physical Earth: accurate determination of the ocean
geoid, forestry, glaciology, geology and agriculture
studies, etc.
- Climate: contribution to the World Climate Research
Programme and to the World Ocean Circulation Experiment
- Weather and Sea: short and medium-term weather
forecasting, sea surface State Forecasting wind speed and
direction, location of pelagic fish through the monitoring
of temperature fronts
- Global Ozone: measures ozone, trace gases, and aerosols
in the troposphere and stratosphere

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The primary objective of the STS-72 mission is to capture and return to Earth a Japanese microgravity research spacecraft known as Space Flyer Unit (SFU). The 7,885lbs SFU spacecraft was launched by Japan's National Space Development Agency (NASDA) from Tanegashima Space Center in Japan at 8:01 UT on March 18, 1995 aboard a Japanese H-II rocket (HII-3).

The STS-72 mission will also deploy (for about 50 hours) and then retrieve the Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology Flyer (OAST-Flyer) spacecraft. OAST-Flyer is the seventh in a series of missions aboard reuseable free-flying Spartan carriers. It consists of four experiments: Return Flux Experiment (REFLEX), Global Positioning System Attitude Determination and Control Experiment (GADACS), Solar Exposure to Laser Ordnance Device (SELODE) and the University of Maryland Spartan Packet Radio Experiment (SPRE).

Other experiments onboard STS-72 include the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Experiment (SSBUV-8) (previously flown on STS-34, STS-41, STS-43, STS-45, STS-56, STS-62 and STS-66), EDFT-03, Shuttle Laser Altimeter Payload (SLA-01/GAS(5)), VDA-2, National Institutes of Health NIH-R3 Experiment, Space Tissue Loss Experiment (STL/NIH-C), Pool Boiling Experiment (PBE) (hardware previously flown on STS-47, STS-57 and STS-60) and the Thermal Energy Storage (TES-2) experiment (previously flown on STS-69).

Get Away Special payloads include the United States Air Force Academy G-342 Flexible Beam Experiment (FLEXBEAM-2), Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies' G-459 - Protein Crystal Growth Experiment and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory GAS Ballast Can with Sample Return Experiment.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">[Source: NASA AQUARIUS mission web site http://aquarius.nasa.gov/ ]

[10-Jun-11] Aquarius/SAC-D rocketed into space at 7:20:13 AM PDT. Less than 57 minutes later it separated from the rocket's second stage and began communicating with ground controllers and unfurling its solar arrays.

Aquarius is a focused satellite mission to measure global Sea Surface Salinity (SSS). Scientific progress is limited because conventional in situ SSS sampling is too sparse to give the global view of salinity variability that only a satellite can provide. Aquarius will resolve missing physical processes that link the water cycle, the climate, and the ocean. Aquarius is planning to launch in 2011.  Aquarius/SAC-D is a space mission developed by NASA and the Space Agency of Argentina (Comisión Nacional de Actividades Espaciales, CONAE.)

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">NOAA-6 was launched in June 1979 and was a third generation
operational meteorological satellite for use in the National
Operational Environmental Satellite System (NOESS) and for the support
of the Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP) during 1978-84.  The
satellite design provided an economical and stable sun-synchronous
platform for advanced operational instruments to measure the earth's
atmosphere, its surface and cloud cover, and the near-space
environment.  The satellite was based upon the Block 5D spacecraft bus
developed for the U.S. Air Force, and it was capable of maintaining an
earth-pointing accuracy of better than plus or minus 0.1 degree with a
motion rate of less than 0.035 degree/second.
Primary sensors included an Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
(AVHRR) and a TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS). Secondary
experiments consisted of a Space Environment Monitor (SEM) and a Data
Collection and Platform Location System (DCPLS). In early 1984, only
one to two NOAA-6 passes were taken per day due to priorities for
NOAA-7 and 8 data.  However, when NOAA-8 failed in late June 1984,
NOAA-6 was returned to full operational status to continue to provide
morning orbit operational data.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) has been chosen as the name for the new family of Meteorological Satellites. Twenty-five years after the rollout of the first meteorological satellite in 1977, some six other Meteosats later, MSG is now a completely new series of geostationary meteorological satellites with three pieces already being produced and others that may follow within the next decade.

MSG is a joint project between ESA and Eumetsat, the organization set up in 1986 to establish, maintain and operate a European system of meteorological satellites. Three satellites are planned at present and a ground segment. ESA is responsible for designing and developing the first satellite - now already in orbit - and for procuring the other three on behalf of Eumetsat. Eumetsat is responsible for defining the payload based on user needs, procuring the ground segment and launchers, and operating the system.

With the launch of MSG-2, at any one time, two MSG satellites will be functional in geostationary orbit, the operational one being at 0 degrees longitude which is above equatorial west Africa, the other being on stand-by with 10 degrees of separation.

The first satellite, MSG-1 has been launched on board an Ariane 5 launcher in
August 2002. MSG-2 will follow later. MSG-3 will be built and put in storage
until it is required to take over as the operational MSG nears the end of its
life. Each satellite will have a nominal seven-year lifetime. A fourth MSG
satellite of the same design is foreseen to ensure continuity of service until
the end of the next decade.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">NASDA launched the Japanese Marine Observation Satellite 1(MOS-1) on
February 19, 1987.  The MOS-1 carries three instruments on board, the
MESSR (Multispectrum Electronic Self Scanning Radiometer), VTIR
(Visible and Thermal Infrared Radiometer) and MSR (Microwave Scanning
Radiometer).  MOS-1 is Japan's first earth observation satellite which
has a sun-synchronous and sub-recurrent orbit at a nominal altitude of
909 km and an inclination of 99 deg.  The local mean time at
descending node is 10:00-11:00 AM.  MOS-1/b, which carries the same
sensors as MOS-1 was launched on February 7, 1990 to provide
continuous data to users.  The following is a summary of MOS-1 and
MOS-1/b.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The 13th flight of the Space Shuttle (STS 41-G) carried the OSTA-3 (Office of Space and Terrestrial Applications) payload designed for conducting experiments in earth remote sensing. This experiment payload consisted of 1) a Shuttle Imaging Radar (SIR-B) for studies of the earth's surface, 2) a Large Format Camera (LFC) for cartographic mappings of the earth, 3) a Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellite (MAPS) experiment to determine the distribution of CO in the atmosphere, and 4) a Feature Identification and Location Experiment (FILE) for classification of surface materials. The SIR-B was an upgraded version of the SIR-A flown on the OSTA-1 payload during the STS-2 mission (NSSDC ID 81-111A-01). The MAPS and FILE sensors were the reflies of those same instruments on the OSTA-1 payload (NSSDC ID 81-111A-04 and 81-111A-03). The mission lasted 8 days and, except for SIR-B, all instruments met their pre launch requirements.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Autonomous Temperature Line Acquisition System was initiated by PMEL's Engineering Development Division (EDD) in 1984. The standard ATLAS mooring had a design lifetime of one year, and the system proved to be robust and reliable. Over 500 Standard ATLAS moorings were deployed between 1984 and 2001. The final standard ATLAS was recovered in November 2001 and NextGeneration ATLAS moorings are now used exclusively in the TAO array.

Standard ATLAS moorings measured surface winds, air temperature, relative humidity, sea surface temperature, and ten subsurface temperatures from a 500 m long thermistor cable. Daily-mean data were telemetered to shore in near real-time via NOAA's polar-oribiting satellites and Service Argos. A small subset of hourly values (2-3 per day) coinciding with satellite passes were also transmitted in real time. Hourly values of surface data were internally recorded and available after mooring recovery.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">While Convair (based in San Diego like the Classic Airliner Page) was quite successful with its piston powered CV-240/340/440 series of twins, it recognized as early as 1950 that turboprop engines offered some clear advantages over the "round engines".  Instead of building a new plane, Convair decided that those very Convair-Liners could be re-engined instead.  An experimental installation of Allison T56 engines into a CV-240 in 1950 was quite successful, but the first commercial conversion did not take place until 1954, and then with British Napier Elands.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Earth Probe TOMS (EP-TOMS) spacecraft was launched on July 2, 1996 from a Pegasus XL rocket and placed into a polar orbit with the following characteristics:
Apogee Altitude : 515.2 km
Perigee Altitude : 490.5 km
Orbit Inclination : 97.432 deg.
Period : 94.6 min

The satellite was built by TRW for NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.

TOMS is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth a long term, coordinated research effort to study the Earth as a global environmental system. Using the unique perspective available from space, NASA will observe, monitor and assess large-scale environmental processes, focusing on climate change. MTPE satellite data, complemented by aircraft and ground data, will allow humans to better understand natural environmental changes and to distinguish natural changes from human induced changes. MTPE data, which NASA will distribute to researchers worldwide, is essential to humans making informed decisions about their environment.

The goal of the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) Earth Probe mission (part of NASA's Mission To Planet Earth (MTPE) Phase I program) was to continue the high-resolution global mapping of total ozone on a daily basis (begun with the Nimbus 7 SBUV/TOMS) as well as to detect global ozone trends to verify depletion predicted by atmospheric chemistry models.

The TOMS-Earth Probe (TOMS-EP), the first of a series of NASA Earth Probe missions, was one of three TOMS missions which included METEOR 3/TOMS2 (launched 1991) and ADEOS/TOMS (launched 1995). The TOMS-EP carried only one instrument: the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS).

The TOMS-EP spacecraft was based on the TRW/DSI Eagle bus developed under the USAF STEP program. The spacecraft was three-axis stabilized so that the TOMS instrument was nadir-pointed with about 0.5 degree control and about 0.1 degree knowledge from measured altitude data. The TOMS-EP spacecraft bus was designed to accomodate all of the TOMS instrument requirements to support a two-year lifetime with a three-year lifetime goal.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Helios 1 was a joint German- American deep space mission to study the main solar processes and solar-terrestrial relationships. Specifically, the spacecraft's instruments were designed to investigate phenomena such as solar wind, magnetic and electric fields, cosmic rays, and cosmic dust in regions between Earth's orbit and approximately 0.3 AU from the Sun. 

It was the largest bilateral project to date for NASA, with Germany paying about $180 million of the total $260-million cost. Germany provided the spacecraft and NASA the launch vehicles. 

After a successful launch, Helios 1 passed within 47 million kilometers of the Sun at a speed of 238,000 kilometers per hour on 15 March 1975, the closest any humanmade object had been to our nearest star. During its mission, the spacecraft spun once every second to evenly distribute the heat coming from the Sun, 90 percent of which was reflected by optical surface mirrors. Its data indicated the presence of fifteen times more micrometeorites close to the Sun than there are near Earth.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Piper PA-23, named Apache and later Aztec, was an American twin-engined monoplane, the first twin-engine aircraft built by Piper Aircraft.

Originally to be named the "Twin-Stinson" and designed as a four-seater low-wing all-metal monoplane with a twin tail, the prototype first flew 2 March 1952. The prototype was then named the PA-21 to conform to Piper's numerical nomenclature[1] It was redesigned with a single vertical stabilizer and an all-metal rear fuselage and renamed to Apache 150 when it entered production in 1954; 1,231 were built. In 1958, the Apache 160 was produced by upgrading the engines to 160 hp (119 kW), and 816 were built before being superseded by the Apache 235, which went to 235 hp (175 kW) engines and swept tail surfaces (119 built).

Declining sales of the Apache prompted the redesign dubbed PA-23-250 Aztec, with 250 hp (186 kW) Lycoming. The first models were delivered with O-540 Lycoming carburetor engines. These first models came in a five-seat configuration which became available in 1959. The later models of the Aztec were equipped with IO-540 fuel-injected engines and six-seat capacity, and continued in production until 1982. There were also turbocharged versions of the later models, which were able to fly at higher altitudes.

 GOES 4 was launched in September 1980 and was a NASA-developed, NOAA-operated, geosynchronous, and operational spacecraft.  The cylindrically shaped spacecraft measured 190.5 cm in diameter and 230 cm in length, exclusive of a magnetometer that extended an additional 83 cm beyond the cylinder shell. The primary structural members were a honeycombed equipment shelf and thrust tube.  The VISSR telescope was mounted on the equipment shelf and viewed the Earth through a special aperture in the side of the spacecraft.  A support structure extended radially out from the thrust tube and was affixed to the solar panels, which formed the outer walls of the spacecraft and provided the primary source of electrical power.  Located in the annulus-shaped space between the thrust tube and the solar panels were stationkeeping and dynamics control equipment, batteries, and most of the SEM equipment.  Proper spacecraft attitude and spin rate (approximately 100 rpm) were maintained by two separate sets of jet thrusters mounted around the spacecraft equator and activated by ground command.  The spacecraft used both UHF-band and S-band frequencies in its telemetry and command subsystem.  A low-power VHF transponder provided telemetry and command during launch and then served as a backup for the primary subsystem once the spacecraft attained orbit.

The spin-stabilized spacecraft carried a visible infrared spin-scan radiometer atmospheric sounder, meteorological data collection and transmission system, space environment monitor, and a biaxial fluxgate magnetometer.  It operated at 100 degrees West initially, but replaced GOES 3 at 135 degrees West in March 1981.  When GOES 5 VAS experienced a failure on July 30, 1984, GOES 4 was reactivated by NOAA to provide GOES 1 VISSR data relay services to western users.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Landsat 3 is the third satellite of the Landsat program. It was launched on
March 5th, 1978, with the primary goal of providing a global archive of
satellite photos. Unlike later Landsats, Landsat 3 was managed solely by NASA.
Landsat 3 is no longer in operation, due to technical failure. It finally
ceased transmission on March 21st 1983, far beyond its designed life expectancy
of one year.

Landsat 3 had essentially the same design as Landsat 2. It carried a
Multi-Spectral Scanner, which had a maximum 75m resolution. Unlike the previous
two Landsat missions a thermal band was built into Landsat 3, but this
instrument failed shortly after the satellite was deployed. [2] Landsat 3 was
placed into a polar orbit at about 920 kilometers, and took 18 days to cover
the entire Earth&amp;#039;s surface.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Lockheed S-3 Viking is a jet aircraft originally used by the United States Navy to identify, track, and destroy enemy submarines. In the late 1990s, the S-3B's mission focus shifted to surface warfare and aerial refueling. After the retirement of the A-6 Intruder and A-7 Corsair II, the Viking was the only airborne refueling platform organic to the Carrier Air Wing(s) until the fielding of the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet...

One aircraft was transformed into a state-of-the-art NASA research aircraft. The Navy's Fleet Readiness Center - Southeast and a Boeing facility in Fla. enhanced the plane by adding commercial satellite communications, global positioning navigation and weather radar systems. They installed research equipment racks in what was once the plane's bomb bay. NASA's S-3B Viking is equipped to conduct science and aeronautics missions, such as environmental monitoring, satellite communications testing and aviation safety research.

Launched on 17 March 2009 - End of mission 10 November 2013, ESA's Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer (GOCE) was developed to bring about a whole new level of understanding of one of Earth's most fundamental forces of nature – the gravity field.
 
Dubbed the 'Formula 1' of satellites, this sleek high-tech gravity satellite embodies many firsts in its design and use of new technology in space to map Earth's gravity field in unprecedented detail. As the most advanced gravity space mission to date, GOCE will realise a broad range of fascinating new possibilities for oceanography, solid Earth physics, geodesy and sea-level research, and significantly contribute to furthering our understanding of climate change.  
 
Although invisible, gravity is a complex force of nature that has an immeasurable impact on our everyday lives. It is often assumed that the force of gravity on the surface of the Earth has a constant value, but in fact the value of 'g' varies subtly from place to place. These variations are due to a number of factors such as the rotation of the Earth, the position of mountains and ocean trenches and variations in density of the Earth's interior.

Over its life of about 20 months, GOCE will map these global variations in the gravity field with extreme detail and accuracy. This will result in a unique model of the 'geoid', which is the surface of equal gravitational potential defined by the gravity field – crucial for deriving accurate measurements of ocean circulation and sea-level change, both of which are affected by climate change. GOCE-derived data are also much needed to understand more about processes occurring inside the Earth and for use in practical applications such as surveying and levelling.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) is an Explorer mission that is
being managed by the Office of Space Science Mission and Payload
Development Division of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA). The primary purpose of ACE is to determine and
compare the isotopic and elemental composition of several distinct
samples of matter, including the solar corona, the interplanetary
medium, the local interstellar medium, and Galactic matter.
The spacecraft is 1.6 meters across and 1 meter high, not including
the four solar arrays and the magnetometer booms attached to two of
the solar panels. It will weigh 785 kg, which includes 189 kg of
hydrazine fuel for orbit insertion and maintenance. The solar arrays
will generate about 500 watts of power at the beginning of life. The
spacecraft will spin at 5 rpm, with the spin axis generally pointed
along the Earth-sun line and most of the scientific instruments on the
top (sunward) deck.  The instruments that are carried on ACE are as follows:
Cosmic Ray Isotope Spectrometer (CRIS), Electon,Proton,and Alpha Monitor
(EPAM), Magnetometer (MAG), Solar Energetic Particle Ionic Charge Analyzer
(SEPICA), Solar Isotope Spectrometer (SIS), Solar Wind Electon, Proton, and
Alpha Monitor (SWEPAM), Solar Wind Ionic Charge Spectrometer (SWICS),
Solar Wind Ion Mass Spectrometer (SWIMS), and Ultra Low Energy Isotope
Spectrometer (ULEIS).

ACE launched on a McDonnell-Douglas Delta II 7920 launch vehicle on
August 25, 1997 from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.
In order to get away from the effects of the Earth's magnetic field,
the ACE spacecraft has travelled almost a million miles (1.5 million
km) from the Earth to the Earth-sun libration point (L1). By orbiting
the L1 point, ACE will stay in a relatively constant position with
respect to the Earth as the Earth revolves around the sun.

Explorer 19 was the second in a series of 3.66-m inflatable spheres placed into orbit to determine atmospheric densities. Explorer 19 was launched while Explorer 9, the first satellite in the series, was still active, so that densities in two different portions of the atmosphere were sampled simultaneously. The satellite consisted of alternating layers of aluminum foil and plastic film. Uniformly distributed over the aluminum outer surface were 5.1-cm dots of white paint for thermal control. A 136.620-MHz tracking beacon, which was powered by four solar cells and was mounted on the spacecraft skin, used the electrically separated hemispheres of the balloon as an antenna. The spacecraft was successfully orbited, but its apogee was lower than planned. The beacon did not have sufficient power to be received by ground tracking stations, making it necessary to rely solely on the SAO Baker-Nunn camera network for tracking.

IMP-6 (IMP-I or Explorer 43, NSSDC ID: 71-019A) was a 16-sided drum-shaped
spacecraft of dimensions: 1.8212 meter high and 1.3564 meter in diameter.
Its mass was 635 kg.  The spacecraft spin axis was perpendicular to the
ecliptic plane with a spin rate of 5 rpm, giving it a spin period of
12 seconds.  IMP-6 continued the study, begun by earlier IMPs, of the
interplanetary and outer magnetospheric regions by measuring energetic
particles, plasma, and electric and magnetic fields.  A radio astronomy
experiment was also included in the spacecraft payload.  The initial
apogee point was near the earth-sun line.  The solar-cell and chemical-
battery powered spacecraft carried two transmitters.  One continuously
transmitted PCM encoder data at a 1600-bps information bit rate.  The
second transmitter was used for transmission of VLF data and for ranging
information.  Three orthogonal pairs of dipole antennas were used for
the electric fields experiments, and one of these pairs was also used
for the radio astronomy experiment.  The members of the antenna pair
along the spacecraft spin axis extended 2.9 meter, the members of the
antennal pair used in both the electric field and radio astronomy
experiments extended 45.5 meter, and the members of the third pair were
slightly unbalanced, extending 24.4 meter and 27.6 meter, respectively.
All four elements perpendicular to the spin axis were to have extended
45.5 meter.  The spacecraft reentered the earth's atmosphere on October 2,
1974, after a highly successful mission.  The IMP (Interplanetary
Monitoring Platform) spacecraft exploration program was carried out by
the United States.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Nimbus-4 was launched in April 1970 and was the fourth in a series of
second-generation meteorological research-and-development satellites that was
designed to serve as a stabilized, earth-oriented platform for the testing of
advanced meteorological sensor systems and for collecting meteorological data.
The polar-orbiting spacecraft consisted of three major structures: (1) a
ring-shaped sensor mount, (2) solar paddles, and (3) the control system
housing. The solar paddles and the control system were connected to the sensor
mount by a truss structure, giving the satellite the appearance of an ocean
buoy. Nimbus-4 was nearly 3.7 m tall, 1.45 m in diameter at the base, and about
3 m across with solar paddles extended. The torus-shaped sensor mount, which
formed the satellite base, housed the electronics equipment and battery
modules. The lower surface of the torus ring provided mounting space for
sensors and telemetry antennas. An H-frame structure mounted within the center
of the torus provided support for the larger experiments and tape recorders.
Mounted on the control system housing, which was on top of the spacecraft, were
sun sensors, horizon scanners, gas nozzles for attitude control, and a command
antenna. Use of an advanced attitude-control subsystem permitted the
spacecraft's orientation to be controlled to within plus or minus 1 degree for
all three axes (pitch, roll, and yaw).
Primary experiments consisted of an image dissector camera system for providing
daytime cloudcover pictures both in real-time and recorded modes,
temperature-humidity infrared radiometer (THIR) for measuring daytime and

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The USGS, in cooperation with more than 800 state, local and other federal agencies, operates approximately 7,000 continuously active streamflow measurement and data collection sites, called streamgages. Almost 5,000 of the USGS's approximately 7,000 streamgages are equipped with telemetry that transmits a reading of stream depth ("stage") to a district office via satellite or telephone. This "realtime" data is used for a multiplicity of purposes: including flood hazard mitigation by the National Weather Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and for resource planning, and infrastructure design of reservoirs and dams.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Learjet started life as an abortive Swiss ground-attack fighter aircraft, the FFA P-16. Development started in 1952 and prototypes were ordered the next year. The first prototypes flew in 1955 and construction and testing continued until 1958 when an order for 100 was placed. This was reversed soon after due to a crash of the third prototype. Two additional prototypes were finished, the last in 1960, but the project was ended at this point.

The basic structure of this aircraft was seen by Bill Lear and his team as a good starting point to the development of a business jet, which was originally intended to be called the SAAC-23. The wing with its distinctive tip fuel tanks and landing gear of the first Learjets were little changed from those used by the fighter prototypes. The tooling for building the aircraft was purchased and moved to Wichita, Kansas in 1962. On February 7, assembly of the first Learjet began. The next year, the company was renamed the Lear Jet Corporation.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The HC-130 is an extended-range, combat rescue version of the C-130 transport aircraft. Capable of independent employment in the no-to-low threat environment. Its primary mission is to provide air refueling for rescue helicopters. The HC-130 can perform extended searches in a permissive environment and has the capability to airdrop pararescuemen and survival equipment to isolated survivors when a delay in the arrival of a recovery vehicle is anticipated. Flights to air refueling areas or drop zones are accomplished at tactical low altitude to avoid threats. NVG-assisted, low-altitude air refueling and other operations in a low-threat environment are performed by specially trained crews. The crew can perform airborne mission commander (AMC) duties in a no-to-low threat environment when threat conditions permit.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Meteosat-2 was launched in June 1981 and was a geostationary
spacecraft that served as part of European Space Agency's (ESA)
contribution to the Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP).  As
part of GARP, the satellite helped to supply data required for global
data sets used in improvement of machine weather forecasts.  In
general, the spacecraft design, instrumentation, and operation were
similar to SMS/GOES.  The cylindrically shaped spacecraft measured 210
cm in diameter and 430 cm in length, including the apogee boost motor.
The primary structural members were an equipment platform and a
central tube. The radiometer telescope was mounted on the equipment
platform and viewed the earth through a special aperture in the side
of the spacecraft. A support structure extended radially out from the
central tube and was affixed to the solar panels, which formed the
outer walls of the spacecraft and provided the primary source of
electrical power.  Located in the annulus-shaped space between the
central tube and the solar panels were station-keeping and dynamics
control equipment and batteries. Proper spacecraft attitude and spin
rate (approximately 100 rpm) were maintained by jet thrusters mounted
on the spacecraft and activated by ground command. The spacecraft used
both UHF-band and S-band frequencies in its telemetry and command
subsystems.  A low-power VHF transponder provided telemetry and
command during launch and then served as a backup for the primary
subsystem once the spacecraft attained synchronous orbit.
The spin-stabilized spacecraft carried (1) a visible-IR radiometer to
provide high-quality day/night cloudcover data and to take radiance
temperatures of the earth/atmosphere system, and (2) a meteorological
data collection system to disseminate image data to user stations, to
collect data from various earth-based platforms, and to relay data
from polar-orbiting satellites.  Meteosat-1 was maintained on station
between 1 degree East and 1 degree West.

  Gemini 11 was the ninth manned earth-orbiting spacecraft of the Gemini
  series.  The  3-day  mission  was  designed  to  achieve a first orbit
  rendezvous  and  docking  with the agena target vehicle, to accomplish
  two  extravehicular  activity  (EVA)  tests, and to perform spacecraft
  maneuvers.  There  were  also  eight scientific and four technological
  experiments  on board. The scientific experiments were (1) synergistic
  effect  of  zero-g  and  radiation  on white blood cells, (2) synoptic
  terrain  photography,  (3)  synoptic  weather photography, (4) nuclear
  emulsions,  (5)  airglow  horizon  photography,  (6)  UV  astronomical
  photography,  (7)  Gemini  ion  wake  measurement,  and  (8)  dim  sky
  photography.  The  experiments  and  the other mission objectives were
  successfully  completed.  Reentry  occurred  after 44 orbits using the
  first closed-loop automatic reentry mode. The spacecraft landed within
  4.8 km of the planned impact point on september 15, 1966.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Mission Objectives:

The Zeya satellite is a Russian Military Communications
satellite launched on March 4, 1997. Zeya is named after the
Zeya River, which is very close to it's launch site, Cosmodrome
Svobodniy. This was the first satellite launched from this new
Russian launch site in far eastern Russia.  Note: Sometimes also
spelled Zeia.

ILRS Mission Support Status: Satellite laser ranging was used
for precision orbit determination for this spacecraft and used
for calibration of GPS and GLONASS navigation equipment aboard
the satellite. This satellite was only tracked for 6 months by
the international laser ranging network. SLR tracking support
was discontinued on 29 July 1997.

Instrumentation:  Zeya has the following instrumentation onboard:

1) Radio equipment
2) GPS receiver
3) GLONASS receiver
4) Laser retroreflector array

RetroReflector Array (RRA) Characteristics: The retro-reflector
array is a box array of 20 corner cubes, which are optimized at
532 nanometers. Twenty retroreflectors operating with principle
"not more than one reflectors works in any direction" are
installed on the satellite. Each retroreflector has field of
view of 35 arc degrees. Retroreflectors ensure reflection of
laser light within 47% of 4 steradian. Satellite's design
provides accuracy of link of range measurements to the center of
mass with root mean square error of about 5 mm. Systematic
correction is 419 mm. The satellite is spinning around Y axis
with angular velocity about 30 revolutions per minute.

 Eole, a.k.a. CAS 1 (Cooperative Application Satellite), FR 2
 (France), the second French experimental data relay satellite
 for meteorological data and the first launched by NASA under a
 cooperative agreement with the Centre National d'Etudes
 Spatiales (CNES), was designed to function primarily as a
 communications satellite to acquire and relay telemetered data
 on altitude, pressure, temperature, moisture, and upper
 atmospheric wind velocities from instrumented earth-circling
 constant density meteorological balloons. The octagonally
 shaped satellite measured 0.71 m across opposite corners and
 was 0.58 m long. Electrical power (20 W average) was supplied
 by eight rectangular solar panels deployed 45 deg from the EOLE
 1 upper octagonal structure after orbital insertion, and by 15
 rechargeable silver-cadmium batteries. Constant earth
 orientation was maintained by a deployable 10.06-m gravity
 gradient boom. Satellite spin was near zero rpm in orbit, and
 the attitude was programme!  d to remain stable within 9 deg of
 local vertical. The data were stored on board the spacecraft
 and unloaded on command when the spacecraft was within range of
 the ground station. The onboard telemetry consisted of (1) a
 136.350-MHz downlink transmitter for relaying balloon telemetry
 to ground stations and also to serve as a tracking beacon, (2)
 a 148.25-MHz receiver for receiving spacecraft commands and
 telemetry programs for balloon operations, and (3) a
 spacecraft-to-balloon transmitter (464.84 MHz) and receiver
 (401.7196 MHz). The satellite operation was successful with the
 exception of the inadvertent destruction of 71 balloons by an
 erroneous ground command. The last balloon ceased transmitting
 in January 1973. However, the spacecraft was subsequently used
 to track and receive data from ocean buoys, icebergs, and
 ships.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Global Monitoring Division (GMD) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Earth Science Research Laboratory (ESRL), conducts sustained observations and research related to source and sink strengths, trends and global distributions of atmospheric constituents that are capable of forcing change in the climate of Earth through modification of the atmospheric radiative environment, those that may cause depletion of the global ozone layer, and those that affect baseline air quality. ESRL accomplishes this mission primarily through long-term measurements of key atmospheric species at sites spanning the globe, including five fully-equipped Baseline Observatories. These key species include carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, methane, nitrous oxide, surface and stratospheric ozone, halogenated compounds including CFC replacements, hydrocarbons, sulfur gases, aerosols, and solar and infrared radiation. The measurements are of the highest quality and accuracy possible, and document global ch!  anges in key atmospheric species, which are all affected by mankind, identifying sources of interannual variability. In addition, research programs in key regions, utilizing an array of platforms including aircraft, balloons, ocean vessels and towers, complement the land-based information. ESRL's data are used to assess climate forcing, ozone depletion and baseline air quality, to develop and test diagnostic and predictive models, and to keep the public, policy makers, and scientists abreast of the current state of our chemical and radiative atmosphere.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Venera 14 Mission Description:

Venera 13 and 14 were identical spacecraft built to take
advantage of the 1981 Venus launch opportunity and launched 5
days apart. The Venera 14 mission consisted of a bus (81-110A)
and an attached descent craft (81-110D). The Venera 14 descent
craft/lander was a hermetically sealed pressure vessel, which
contained most of the instrumentation and electronics, mounted
on a ring-shaped landing platform and topped by an antenna. The
design was similar to the earlier Venera 9-12 landers. It
carried instruments to take chemical and isotopic measurements,
monitor the spectrum of scattered sunlight, and record electric
discharges during its descent phase through the Venusian
atmosphere. The spacecraft utilized a camera system, an X-ray
fluorescence spectrometer, a screw drill and surface sampler, a
dynamic penetrometer, and a seismometer to conduct
investigations on the surface.  After launch and a four month
cruise to Venus, the descent vehicle separated from the bus and
plunged into the Venus atmosphere on 5 March 1982. After
entering the atmosphere a parachute was deployed. At an altitude
of about 50 km the parachute was released and simple airbraking
was used the rest of the way to the surface. Venera 14 landed
about 950 km southwest of Venera 13 near the eastern flank of
Phoebe Regio at 13 deg 15 min S by 310 E on a basaltic
plain. After landing an imaging panorama was started and a
mechanical drilling arm reached to the surface and obtained a
sample, which was deposited in a hermetically sealed chamber,
maintained at 30 degrees C and a pressure of about .05
atmospheres. The composition of the sample was determined by the
X-ray flourescence spectrometer, showing it to be similar to
oceanic tholeiitic basalts. The lander survived for 57 minutes
(the planned design life was 32 minutes) in an environment with
a temperature of 465 degrees C and a pr!  essure of 94 Earth
atmospheres. The descent vehicle transmitted data to the bus,
which acted as a data relay as it.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">GOES 9 was launched on May 23, 1995. GOES-9, which is currently
partially operational, is being provided to the Japanese Meteorological
Agency to replace their failing geostationary satellite.

GOES I-M represents the next generation of meteorological satellites
and introduces two new features.  The first feature, flexible scan,
offers small-scale area imaging that lets meteorologists take pictures
of local weather trouble spots. This allows them to improve short-term
forecasts over local areas. The second feature, simultaneous and
independent imaging and sounding, is designed to allow weather
forecasters to use multiple measurements of weather phenomena to
increase the accuracy of their forecasts.

Each satellite in the series carries two major instruments: an Imager
and a Sounder. These instruments acquire high resolution visible and
infrared data, as well as temperature and moisture profiles of the
atmosphere. They continuously transmit these data to ground terminals
where the data are processed for rebroadcast to primary weather
services both in the United States and around the world, including the
global research community.

The GOES I-M mission is scheduled to run from the mid-1990s into the
first decade of the 21st century.  Each element of the mission has
been designed to meet all in-orbit performance requirements for at
least five years.
The GOES I-M system performs the following basic functions:
+ Acquisition, processing, and dissemination of imaging and
sounding data.
+ Acquisition and dissemination of Space Environment Monitor
(SEM) data.
+ Reception and relay of data from ground-based Data Collection
Platforms (DCPs) that are situated in carefully selected urban and
remote areas to the NOAA Command and Data Acquisition (CDA) station.
+ Continuous relay of Weather Facsimile (WEFAX) and other data to
users, independent of all other functions.
+ Relay of distress signals from people, aircraft, or marine vessels
to the search and rescue ground stations of the Search and Rescue
Satellite Aided Tracking (SARSAT) system.
GOES provides the instantaneous relay functions for the SARSAT system.
A dedicated search and rescue transponder on board GOES is designed to
detect emergency distress signals originating from Earth-based
sources. These unique identification signals are normally combined
with signals received by a low-Earth orbiting satellite system and
relayed to a search and rescue ground terminal. The combined data are
used to perform effective search and rescue operations.
The GOES I-M system serves a region covering the central and eastern
Pacific Ocean; North, Central, and South America; and the central and
western Atlantic Ocean. Pacific coverage includes Hawaii and the Gulf
of Alaska. This is accomplished by two satellites, GOES West located
at 135 west longitude and GOES East at 75 west longitude. A common
ground station, the CDA station located at Wallops, Virginia,
supports the interface to both satellites. The NOAA Satellite
Operations Control Center (SOCC), in Suitland, Maryland, provides
spacecraft scheduling, health and safety monitoring, and engineering
analyses.

Delivery of products involves ground processing of the raw instrument
data for radiometric calibration and Earth location information, and
retransmission to the satellite for relay to the data user community.
The processed data are received at the control center and disseminated
to the National Weather Service's (NWS) National Meteorological
Center, Camp Springs, Maryland, and NWS forecast offices, including
the National Hurricane Center, Miami, Florida, and the National Severe
Storms Forecast Center, Kansas City, Missouri. Processed data are also
received by Department of Defense installations, universities, and
numerous private commercial users.

GOES-I/M IMAGER
The GOES Imager is a multi-channel instrument designed to sense
radiant and solar-reflected energy from sampled areas of the
Earth. The multi-element spectral channels simultaneously sweep
east-west and west-east along a north-to-south path by means of a
two-axis mirror scan system. The instrument can produce full-Earth
disc images, sector images that contain the edges of the Earth, and
various sizes of area scans completely enclosed within the Earth scene
using a new flexible scan system. Scan selection permits rapid
continuous viewing of local areas for monitoring of mesoscale
(regional) phenomena and accurate wind determination.

GOES-I/M SOUNDER
The GOES Sounder is a 19-channel discrete-filter radiometer covering
the spectral range from the visible channel wavelengths to 15
microns. It is designed to provide data from which atmospheric
temperature and moisture profiles, surface and cloud-top temperatures,
and ozone distribution can be deduced by mathematical analysis. It
operates independently of and simultaneously with the Imager, using a
similarly flexible scan system. The Sounder's multi-element detector
array assemblies simultaneously sample four separate fields or
atmospheric columns. A rotating filter wheel, which brings spectral
filters into the optical path of the detector array, provides the
infrared channel definition.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) is an advanced land-imaging mission that will demonstrate new instruments and spacecraft systems. EO-1 will validate technologies contributing to the significant reduction in cost of follow-on Landsat missions. Launched on a Delta 7320 from Vandenberg Air Force Base, California, November 21, 2000. EO-1 has a 1-year primary mission but was designed to operate for an additional year.

The NMP EO-1 mission includes three advanced land imaging instruments and five revolutionary cross cutting spacecraft technologies. The hyperspectral instrument is the first of its kind to provide images of land-surface in more than 220 spectral colors. The Hyperion will demonstrate the ability to perform detailed spectral mapping with high radiometric accuracy. In the future, an operational version of the Hyperion will allow complex land ecosystems to be imaged and accurately classified. The Advanced Land Imager (ALI) instrument yields almost four times better performance at only one-fourth the cost and weight of the Landsat ETM+. Finally the Linear Etalon Imaging Spectral Array/Atmospheric Corrector (LEISA/AC) is an infrared camera, which can be used to remove the effects of the atmosphere from surface pictures obtained by instruments such as the ALI on EO-1 and Landsat. This instrument will provide scientific return both in terms of improved imagery and hyperspectral sensing capabilities. It will also test a number of new technologies. Because the AC is small and adaptable to different spacecraft configurations, it is a bolt-on instrument, which can be attached to any future Earth imaging spacecraft. The three advanced imaging instruments will lead to a new generation of lighter weight, higher performance and lower cost Landsat-type Earth surface imaging instruments.

GOES 2 was a NASA-developed, NOAA-operated, geosynchronous, and operational spacecraft. The spin-stabilized spacecraft carried (1) a visible infrared spin-scan radiometer (VISSR) to provide high-quality day/night cloudcover data and to take radiance-derived temperatures of the earth/atmosphere system, (2) a meteorological data collection and transmission system to relay processed data from central weather facilities to APT-equipped regional stations and to collect and retransmit data from remotely located earth-based platforms, and (3) a space environment monitor (SEM) system to measure proton, electron, and solar X-ray fluxes and magnetic fields. The cylindrically shaped spacecraft measured 190.5 cm in diameter and 230 cm in length, exclusive of a magnetometer that extended an additional 83 cm beyond the cylinder shell. The primary structural members were a honeycombed equipment shelf and thrust tube. The VISSR telescope was mounted on the equipment shelf and viewed the earth through a special aperture in the side of the spacecraft. A support structure extended radially out from the thrust tube and was affixed to the solar panels, which formed the outer walls of the spacecraft and provided the primary source of electrical power. Located in the annulus-shaped space between the thrust tube and the solar panels were stationkeeping and dynamics control equipment, batteries, and most of the SEM equipment. Proper spacecraft attitude and spin rate (approximately 100 rpm) were maintained by two separate sets of jet thrusters mounted around the spacecraft equator and activated by ground command. The spacecraft used both UHF-band and S-band frequencies in its telemetry and command subsystem. A low-power VHF transponder provided telemetry and command during launch and then served as a backup for the primary subsystem once the spacecraft attained synchronous orbit. For more detailed information, see "The GOES/SMS User's Guide" (TRF B28599), available from NSSDC.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The MIPS2 is a mobile profiling system with several components
and capabilities.

1. Radian: (915 MHz 5-beam Doppler profiling radar) collects
Doppler spectra, calculates the spectrum moments, determines
wind profiles at 1-60 min intervals, acquires,
vertically-pointing data at 40-60 times resolution and 60, 105,
or 210 m vertical resolution.

2. Radian: (2 kHz Doppler sodar) determines wind profiles w and
backscatter power at 20 s time resolution and 25 m vertical
resolution.

3. Radio Acoustic Sounding System (RASS): using the sodar as the
acoustic source, the profile of T can be determined fro ~120 m
to 0.5-1.5 km AGL, dependent on water vapor content, wind speed
and turbulence.

4. Vailalla: (0.906 um lidar ceilometer) determines cloud base
and provides a good estimate of the lidar backscatter (or
extinction coefficient) from aerosols, clouds, and
precipitation.

5. Radiometrics: (12 channel microwave radiometer) measures
profiles of T, water vapor, cloud water, and column integrated
values of water vapor and cloud water, at 10 min intervals up to
10 km, with highest vertical resolution oat low levels. This
system also includes an infrared pyranometer, which measures
cloud base temperature.

6. Zenith cloud imaging system: This will consist of an upward
directed computer controlled, digital camera system that will
provide visible images of the sky at user-selected levels.

7. Surface Instrumentation: T, relative humidity, wind,
pressure, solar radiation, and rainfall rate, all at 1-s
resolution, An improved aspiration system designed for rainy
high wind conditions has been designed for accurate measurements
of T and RH.

The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-P represents a continuation of the newest generation of environmental satellites built by Boeing for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under the technical guidance and project management of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.  

GOES satellites provide the familiar weather pictures seen on United States television newscasts every day. The GOES imaging and sounding instruments (built by ITT) feature flexible scans for small-scale area viewing in regions of the visible and infrared spectrum allowing meteorologists to improve short-term forecasts. GOES provides nearly continuous imaging and sounding, which allow forecasters to better measure changes in atmospheric temperature and moisture distributions and hence increase the accuracy of their forecasts.  

GOES environmental information is used for a host of applications, including weather monitoring and prediction models, ocean temperatures and moisture locations, climate studies, cryosphere (ice, snow, glaciers) detection and extent, land temperatures and crop conditions, and hazards detection. 

The GOES-O&amp;P Imagers have improved resolution in the 13 micrometer channel from 8 km to 4 km. The finer spatial resolution allows an improved cloud-top product, height of atmospheric motion vectors and volcanic ash detection. GOES-P continues the improved image navigation and registration, additional power and fuel lifetime capability, space weather, solar x-ray imaging, search and rescue, and communication services as provided on GOES-13.

GOES-P Launches!

The GOES-P satellite launched at 6:57 p.m. EST March 4 aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta IV rocket from Launch Complex 37B at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. 
 
GOES-P is the third and final spacecraft to be launched in the GOES-N series of geostationary environmental weather satellites.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Orbiting Geophysical Observatory 4 (OGO 4) was a large observatory
instrumented with experiments designed to study the interrelationships between
the aurora and airglow emissions, energetic particle activity, geomagnetic
field variation, ionospheric ionization and recombination, and atmospheric
heating which take place during a period of increased solar activity. After the
spacecraft achieved orbit and the experiments were deployed into an operating
mode, an attitude control problem occurred.  This condition was corrected by
ground control procedures until complete failure of the tape recording systems
in mid-January 1969.  At that time, due to the difficulty of maintaining
attitude control without the tape recorders, the attitude control system was
commanded off, and the spacecraft was placed into a spin-stabilized mode about
the axis which was previously maintained vertically.  In this mode, seven of
the remaining experiments were turned off since no meaningful data could be
observed by them.  On October 23, 1969, the satellite was turned off. It was
reactivated again in January 1970 for 2 months to obtain VLF observations.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">SSTL developed the UK-DMC-1 satellite (also known as BNSCsat-1) for the British National Space Centre (BNSC) under a grant from the Microsatellite Applications in Collaboration (MOSAIC) programme. Through UK-DMC, BNSC became the anchor tenant for the SSTL-led Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC), accelerating the formation of a full international consortium.

UK-DMC is a satellite of the standard Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) design, with added research and development payloads. Like all of the standard DMC satellites, it carries an optical imaging payload developed by SSTL to provide 32-m ground resolution with an exceptionally wide swath width of over 640 km. The payload uses green, red and near infrared bands equivalent to Landsat TM+ bands 2, 3 and 4. In comparison to the other DMC satellites, UK-DMC features increased on-board data storage, with 1.5 gigabyte capacity. Images are returned to the SSTL mission operations centre using the Internet Protocol over an 8-Mbps S-band downlink.

UK-DMC also contains a commercial Internet router from Cisco Systems, which builds on the use of the Internet Protocol by the DMC satellites to experiment with Internet packet routing to and in space.

UK-DMC has also provided an opportunity for SSTL to test a new concept in remote sensing, GPS reflectometry. This technique, which measures the signals from the GPS navigation system after they are reflected off the sea, could revolutionize oceanographic remote sensing. If UK-DMC validates theories of GPS reflectometry, the technique could one day enable satellites to measure the height of waves on the high seas, providing important data to ship owners and operators. SSTL is using imagery from the UK-DMC to investigate the full range of uses for large-coverage images with medium spatial resolution and high temporal resolution. The UK-DMC satellite will also operate as part of a constellation providing images to disaster relief agencies worldwide in times of need.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) is a
Department of Defense (DoD) program run by the Air Force Space
and Missle Systems Center (SMC). The DMSP designs, builds,
launches, and maintains satellites monitoring the
meteorological, oceanographic, and solar-terrestrial physics
environments.

Each DMSP satellite has a 101 minute, sun-synchronous near-polar
orbit at an altitude of 830km above the surface of the
earth. The visible and infrared sensors (OLS) collect images
across a 3000km swath, providing global coverage twice per
day. The combination of day/night and dawn/dusk satellites
allows monitoring of global information such as clouds every 6
hours. The microwave imager (MI) and sounders (T1, T2) cover one
half the width of the visible and infrared swath. These
instruments cover polar regions at least twice and the
equatorial region once per day. The space environment sensors
(J4, M, IES) record along-track plasma densities, velocities,
composition and drifts.

The data from the DMSP satellites are received and used at
operational centers continuously. The data are sent to the
National Geophysical Data Center's Solar Terrestrial Physics
Division (NGDC/STP) by the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) for
creation of an archive.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Infrared Astronomy Satellite (IRAS)was a joint scientific
project sponsored by the United Kingdom, the United States, and
the Netherlands. IRAS was launched in January of 1983 and ended
its mission ten months later. IRAS' mission was to map the
entire sky at infrared wavelengths. It was equipped with a
special infrared telescope to scan the sky. IRAS was the first
satellite to discover a comet. The comet IRAS-Araki-Alcock was
named for the probe and two co-discovering astronomers. During
its lifespan, IRAS observed 20,000 galaxies, 130,000 stars and
90,000 other space objects and star clusters. IRAS detectors
found a disk of dusty material and fine rock around the star
Vega which may be an early stage in the formation of a new solar
system. IRAS' most famous discovery was that of a new type of
galaxy, a starburst galaxy. In starburst galaxies, new stars are
forming more rapidly than in other types of galaxies.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Launched on August 12, 2003, SCISAT helps a team of Canadian and international scientists improve their understanding of the depletion of the ozone layer, with a special emphasis on the changes occurring over Canada and in the Arctic.

SCISAT focuses its attention in the stratosphere, where the ozone layer is located. SCISAT is providing the most accurate measurements to date of chemicals that affect ozone, which blocks the sun's biologically damaging ultraviolet radiation and prevents most of it from reaching the Earth's surface.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">ENVISAT was successfully launched on March 1, 2002 from Kourou, French
Guiana on Europe's Ariane 5 launcher.

The ENVIronmental SATellite (ENVISAT) is an element of the European
Space Agency (ESA) Columbus Programme. The ENVISAT satellite is part
of the International Earth Observation System (IEOS). The ENVISAT is
designed to study Earth's resources and to contribute to the study of
land surface properties, atmospheric chemistry, aerosol distribution,
ocean and ice processes, and marine biology. The ENVISAT spacecraft
is based on the Polar Platform (PPF) concept and consists of a Service
Module (SM) which provides main support functions, and a
mission-specific Payload Module (PLM) which provides the instruments
and payload support functions. The Payload Module consists of the
Payload Equipment Bay (PEB) and the Payload Carrier (PLC). The Payload
Data Management Subsystem performs instrument and support subsystems,
data processing, telecommand and telemetry management, data-bus
control, failure management, and instrument operations timeline
management. Commonad and control is provided by the Payload Module
Computer (PMC). Scientific data generated from the instruments will be
processed by the High Speed Multiplexer (HSM) for recording or
transmission to the ground.  A set of four tape recorders provide a
recording speed of 2 to 4 Mbps and a capacity of 25 Gbits. The
communication subsystem uses an x-band link directly to the ground and
a Ka-band bi-directional link via ESA's Data Relay Satellite
(DRS). The Thermal Control Subsystem consists of a Heater Switching
Unit (HSU), heaters, thermistors and thermostats. The Service Module
(SM) consists of a carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) cone with a
launcher interface at one end and a propulsion module at the
other. The power subsystem consists of up to eight nickel-cadmium
batteries (40 Ahr) and a modular solar array. The SM on-board data
management is done by the Central Computer Unit (CCU). Command and
contral are done via S-band communications direct to the ground or
through the DRS. The Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem (AOCS)
provides three-axis stabilization.  Altitude measurements will be
provided by digital Sun sensors, Earth-horizon sensors and gyroscopes
while altitude control will be provided by monopropellent
thrusters. Fine pointing is accomplished through star sensors and
gyroscopes, reaction wheels, and magneto-torquers.

The ENVISAT consists of : (1) Advanced SAR (ASAR), (2) Global Ozone
Monitoring by Occultation of Stars (GOMOS), (3) Medium Resolution Imaging
Spectrometer (MERIS), (4) Michelson Interferometer for Passive Atmospheric
Sounding (MIPAS), (5) Radar Altimeter-2 (RA-2), (6) Advanced Along Track
Scanning Radiometer (AATSR), (7) Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer
for Atmospheric Cartography (SCIMACHY), (8) Microwave Radiometer (MWR),
(9) Doppler Orbitography and Radiopositioning Integrated by Satellite
(DORIS), and (10) a Laser Retroreflector (LRR) for tracking.

Just weeks after celebrating its tenth year in orbit, communication with the Envisat satellite was suddenly lost on 8 April. Following rigorous attempts to re-establish contact and the investigation of failure scenarios, the end of the mission is being declared.

Gemini (GPS-based Orbit Estimation and Laser Metrology for
Intersatellite Navigation) is a technology mission, proposed by
DLR?s German Space Operations Center (GSOC), Astrium GmbH, and
Vectronic Aerospace GmbH. aiming The major Gemini mission
objective is the controlled establishment of a satellite
formation in a low-Earth orbit. To that end, advanced in-orbit
technologies will be demonstrated based on laser metrology, as
well as innovative GPS-based approaches to relative
navigation. As part of its technological objectives, the Gemini
formation control will entirely be based on an autonomous orbit
control approach. Secondary mission objectives concern the
separation concept from the launcher, the drift stop and the
development of a controlled formation acquisition strategy. As
a technology demonstration mission, emphasis is given to an
independent verification of the relative distance by means of a
laser radar sensor. To allow a formation flying demonstration
for a wide ran ge of applications, the technologies for the
control of the relative distance cover both the regime of close
and wide formations ranging from several hundreds of meters up
to 100 km. In contrast to the relaxed orbit control
requirements of nowadays formations, Gemini aims at a relative
position keeping of several cm to several meters, that is
expected to be of significance for many of the upcoming
formation flying missions and, in addition, paves the way for
even more advanced requirements, such as for SMART 2. To
achieve that level of control accuracy, the Gemini sensors have
to provide relative position measurements in the range of
millimeters or better, that may not be achievable solely using
a spaceborne GPS receiver.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Coastal-Marine Automated Network (C-MAN) was established by NDBC for the NWS in the early 1980's. The development of C-MAN was in response to a need to maintain meteorological observations in U. S. coastal areas. Such observations, which had been made previously by USCG personnel, would have been lost as many USCG navigational aids were automated under the Lighthouse Automation and Modernization Program (LAMPS). In all, approximately 60 stations make up C-MAN.

C-MAN stations have been installed on lighthouses, at capes and beaches, on near shore islands, and on offshore platforms (see the NDBC station location map for all station locations).

C-MAN station data typically include barometric pressure, wind direction, speed and gust, and air temperature; however, some C-MAN stations are designed to also measure sea water temperature, water level, waves, relative humidity, precipitation, and visibility. These data are processed and transmitted hourly to users in a manner almost identical to moored buoy data. In addition to the conventional method of data transmission, certain C-MAN stations are equipped with telephone modems that allow more frequent data acquisition, data quality checking, and remote payload reconfiguration or restarting.

The Northrop Grumman (formerly Ryan Aeronautical) RQ-4 Global Hawk (known as Tier II+ during development) is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) used by the United States Air Force and Navy as a surveillance aircraft.

In role and operational design, the Global Hawk is similar to the Lockheed U-2, the venerable 1950s spy plane. It is a theater commander's asset to provide a broad overview and systematic target surveillance. For this purpose, the Global Hawk is able to provide high resolution Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)—that can penetrate cloud-cover and sandstorms— and Electro-Optical/Infrared (EO/IR) imagery at long range with long loiter times over target areas. It can survey as much as 40,000 square miles (103,600 square kilometers) of terrain a day.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">ROCSat-2 is an NSPO (National Space Program Office) of Taiwan Earth imaging satellite with the objective to collect high-resolution panchromatic (2 m) and multispectral (8 m) imagery for a great variety of applications such as in land use, agriculture and forestry, environmental monitoring, natural disaster evaluation, and in support of research interests, in particular with the ISUAL instrument. Daily image coverage of Taiwan and the surrounding region is required.

Background: A contract was signed in May 1999 between NSPO and DASA/DSS (Dornier Satelliten Systeme GmbH) of Germany to build a high-resolution optical imaging satellite. However, the German government refused to give DASA/DSS an export licence for the S/C (the People's Republic of China was protesting the deal). The stalemate was resolved in Dec. 1999 when NSPO signed a new contract with MMS (now Astrium SAS of France). Quick approval of the export of ROCSat-2 was provided by the French government. The ROCSat program is part of a long-term effort in Taiwan to develop an autonomous space capability.

Note: A public naming competition took place in Taiwan in 2004 with regard to the ROCSat satellite program. At the end of this contest, the ROCSat program was given the new name of FormoSat in December 2004. Hence, ROCSat-2 became FormoSat-2. 

Spacecraft:

The spacecraft bus has been built by EADS Astrium SAS (prime contractor) of Vélizy, France, based on the Leostar 500 XO family. There were also contributions from Taiwanese industry (including satellite computers, S-band antennas, and sun sensors). The S/C structure consists basically of a hexagonal body of 1.6 m side length (diameter), 2.4 m in height. The satellite is three-axis stabilized. The upper deck of the platform carries the payload (RSI and ISUAL) and also part of AOCS (Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem), namely the star sensors and gyroscopes. The lower deck carries the four reaction wheels and the autonomous propulsion module. The pointing accuracy is &amp;lt; 0.7 km (0.12º); the position knowledge is &amp;lt; 70 m (0.02º). The fixed solar array uses GaAs cells and consists of two deployable flaps. The entire S/C architecture is designed in such a way as to provide a low roll inertia, a key factor for satellite agility and instrument line-of-sight stability. The S/C provides a body-pointing capability of ±45º in roll and pitch (45º pitch in 60 s, 10º roll in 25 s, 30º roll in 60 s, respectively). The S/C wet mass is about 746 kg with 81 kg of propellant (N2H4) mass. The design life is five years or better.

Launch: A launch of ROCSat-2 took place on May 20, 2004 (UTC) on a Taurus-XL vehicle of OSC (Orbital Sciences Corporation) from VAFB, CA (maiden flight of Taurus-XL configuration which offers greater lift capability compared to previous versions of the Taurus rocket).

Orbit: Sun-synchronous circular orbit, mean altitude = 888 km, inclination = 99.14º, period of 102.9 minutes, the LTDN (Local Time of Descending Node) is 9:26 AM (14 orbits/day). The agility of the spacecraft provides a daily revisit capability for event/disaster monitoring.

Note: Following the early-orbit checkout, the initial satellite orbit has been raised from 728 km to 888 km altitude in the period May 23 to June 2, 2004. A total of 32 burns were performed by the propulsion module with 4 burns for inclination change, to enter into the mission orbit with an altitude of 891 km and an inclination of 99.14º.

Ground segment: The basic elements of the ROCSat-2 ground segment are the MMC (Multi Mission Center) and the XAS (X-band Acquisition System) located in Hsinchu, Taiwan. MMC in turn consists of MOC (Mission Operations Center), MCC (Mission Control Center), SCC (Science Control Center), FDF (Flight Dynamics Facility), and GCN (Ground Communications Network). ROCSat-2 X-band imagery reception is also made available to third parties (international partners) with their own ground stations through cooperative agreements.

Mission status: The spacecraft and its payload are operating nominally as of 2007.

Mission operations started in June 2004 (the checkout and performance verification for satellite bus and RSI were started on May 21 and completed through June 2004; all performance requirements of FormoSat-2 had been successfully verified in orbit). Besides providing imagery for the domestic needs of Taiwan, the S/C is frequently being used to deliver high-resolution imagery for event monitoring (coverage of the Tsunami in Asia on Dec. 26, 2004 and thereafter, coverage of Hurricane Katarina in Aug. 2005, coverage of Typhoons on the Pacific, coverage of earthquake regions, etc.). The spacecraft is operating nominally as of 2006. 7) 8) 9) 10)

• NSPO has contracted to SPOT Image S.A. for the international distribution of FORMOSAT-2 images since June 2004

• On 4 July 2004, ISUAL successfully observed the first images of sprites, sprite halo, and elves.

• In April 2005, NSPO implemented a terminal in Kiruna, Sweden, to serve as an additional receiving station

• In May 2006, NSPO implemented a F2T (FormoSat-2 Terminal) in Svalbard, Norway, to extend the data acquisition capability of the mission.

SOH (State-of-Health) trending during two years of mission operations (May 2004-May 2006) on five major subsystems, including AOCS and EPS (Electric Propulsion Subsystem), and one major payload have been conducted. All parameters were well within specifications. The C&amp;amp;DH and the TT&amp;amp;C do not exhibit any SOH problems so far.

RSI (Remote Sensing Instrument), built by EADS Astrium SAS, France. RSI is made up of the camera and IPU (Instrument Processing Unit). The camera itself consists of the optical subassembly, the secondary structure, and the FPA (Focal Plane Assembly). The Korsch telescope (mirrors &amp;amp; structure) design and the focal plane structure are being made of SiC (Silicon Carbide). The video electronics, sequencer, DC/DC converter, and compression cards comprise the IPU.

RSI utilizes the agility of the satellite bus for stereo imaging over a specific region, continuous imaging over a slender region, and mosaic imaging over a large region. The imaging capability is 8 minutes per orbit, and the imaging areas during one cycle can be one 3000 km x 24 km continuous strip, two 100 km x 24 km stereo pairs, four 100 km x 24 km strips, or eight scenes.

ISUAL (Imager of Sprites: Upper Atmospheric Lightning). ISUAL is a joint international research program of NSPO, UCB (University of California at Berkeley), National Cheng Kung University of Taiwan, and Tohoku University, Japan. The objective is to observe the natural upward lightning discharge phenomena toward the ionosphere on top of the troposphere, referred to as TLEs (Transient Luminous Events). The requirements call for: 14)

• To determine the location and timing of luminous phenomena above thunder clouds to investigate their spatial, temporal and spectral properties

• To obtain a global survey of upper atmospheric optical flash transients (sprites, elves, blue jets, gigantic jets, etc.).

The instrument consists of four elements: a) intensified sprite imager, b) a six-channel spectrophotometer, c) a two-channel array photometer, and d) an electronics package. The imager is a staring-type frame CCD camera, taking 180 frames/s with a resolution of 512 x 80 pixels in a FOV of 20º x 3.15º. In Figure 8, the large disk of the ISUAL instrument contains six color filters, which can be rotated to select wavelength for measuring the emission spectrum of red sprites. ISUAL is operated in three modes:

• The sprite continuous mode to take images with a sample rate of 100 Hz

• The sprite burst mode with a sample rate of 1000 Hz

• The auroral mode at a constant rate of 1 sample/s.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">COSMO-SkyMed (Constellation of Small Satellites for Mediterranean basin Observation) is a 4-spacecraft constellation, conceived by ASI (Agenzia Spaziale Italiana), and funded by the Italian Ministry of Research (MUR) and the Italian Ministry of Defense (MOD), Rome, Italy. The program is managed in cooperation by ASI and MOD. Each of the four satellites is equipped with a SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) instrument and is capable of operating in all visibility conditions at high resolution and in real time.

The overall objective of this program is global Earth observation and the relevant data exploitation for the needs of the military community as well as for the civil (institutional, commercial) community.

Sample applications of COSMO-SkyMed data are seen the following fields:

• Defense and security applications: Surveillance, intelligence, mapping, damage assessment, vulnerability assessment, target detection/localization

• Risk management applications: Floods, droughts, landslides, volcanic/seismic, forest fire, industrial hazards, water pollution

• Other applications: Marine and coastal environments, agriculture, forestry, cartography, environment, geology and exploration, telecommunication, utilities and planning

• Provision of commercial imaging services

• The high revisit frequency offered by the four X-band SAR spacecraft is also expected to provide a unique potential to the operational meteorological user community through provision of ancillary data and/or data on meteo-correlated phenomena, in particular as regards sea ice monitoring and study of ocean wave patterns.

Background: In 1996 the Italian Government provided initial funding for the realization of a national Earth observation program. In 1997 the general guidelines for the 1998-2002 Italian National Space Plan (PSN) were approved including the activities on Earth observation. The strategic element in this plan is the COSMO-SkyMed dual-use program of ASI. 1) 2)

In the summer of 2001, the Italian Ministry of Defense became a partner in the COSMO-SkyMed program (a welcome funding partner for the Italian Ministry of Research). However, the dual-use nature of the COSMO-SkyMed program, i. e. civil (research and commercial) and military use of its data products, resulted in a virtually classified program. A great disadvantage of the new arrangement is that rather sparse technical information of the mission can only be made available to the public.

Although the first constellation satellite SAR instruments (SAR-2000) will observe in X-band (9.6 GHz with a wavelength of 3.1 cm), multi-mode scenarios (X-, C- L- and P-band) are planned for the future.

The overall system architecture is composed of a space segment, a constellation of SAR satellites, and a ground segment including full featured user services. The requirements call for the following general performance characteristics: 3)

• Full global observation coverage with all weather, day/night acquisition capability

• Collection capability of large areas within a single pass, with along-track stereo imaging during a single pass

• High image quality, to allow a robust image interpretability at the requested scale of analysis (data sets are characterized by adequate spatial and spectral resolution suitable to perform analyses at different scales of detail)

• Ground track repeatability: the satellites of the SAR constellation shall have a ground track repeatability of better than 1 km

• Fast response times (from the data/service user request up to the data/service delivery to that requiring user).

The SABRINA project was started in 2004/5. 

The COSMO-SkyMed space segment is composed of a constellation of four SAR satellites. The PRIMA \[Piattaforma Riconfigurabile Italiana Multi-Applicativa (Reconfigurable Italian Platform for Multiple Applications)\] bus of Alcatel Alenia Space is being employed. Alcatel Alenia Space is also the prime contractor of the space segment \[funding by ASI and I-AD (Ministry of Defense)\]. - Note: As of April 10, 2007, the EC approved the transfer to Thales of Alcatel-Lucent's shareholdings in the two space sector joint venture companies Alcatel Alenia Space and Telespazio. Hence, Alcatel Alenia Space was renamed to Thales Alenia Space.

The S/C is three-axis stabilized, it consists of the main body (bus), two deployable solar arrays, and a SAR antenna. The bus provides all support functions like: AOCS, electrical power (power generation, storage and distribution), data handling, thermal control, RF communications, and on-orbit propulsion for orbit injection and maintenance. The platform mechanical configuration consists of two elements or modules, namely:

• SVM (Service Module) at the bottom of the bus which contains all bus subsystems including the propulsion module

• PLM (Payload Module) at the top, dedicated to the payload complement, the PDHT (Payload Data Handing and Transmission) subsystem, and the AOCS (Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem) with star trackers gyros actuators.

The bus structure material is CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic) while SVM and PLM consist of aluminum alloys. The interfaces of the SAR antenna, star trackers and gyros are mounted on the CFRP structure for pointing precision and stability (a star tracker is being used as well as a high-quality GPS receiver). The SSTI (Satellite-to-Satellite Tracking Instrument) is the LAGRANGE GPS receiver of Laben SpA. The SAR antenna bore sight is pointing with an incidence angle about 38º to the right side of the S/C ground track. AOCS provides an antenna steering capability of ±2º in yaw as well as for a re-pointing capability to the left side of the ground track. Each S/C in the constellation features a RCT (Reaction Control Thruster) system for orbit maintenance.

The mass of each spacecraft is about 1700 kg. The design life is 5 years. The S/C provides an onboard operational autonomy for a period of 24 hours. 

Launch: The launch of the first COSMO spacecraft in the constellation took place on June 8, 2007 (UTC). The launch was provided by the Boeing Company on a Delta-2 (7420-10 configuration) vehicle from VAFB, CA. This represented the first commercial Delta-2 launch since the formation of the United Launch Alliance (ULA) in December 2006.

Circular sun-synchronous dawn-dusk orbit, nominal altitude = 619.6 km, inclination = 97.86º, period = 97.1 min, with LTAN (Local Time of Ascending Node) at 6:00 AM, 14.8125 rev./day (or 14 13/16). All spacecraft of the SAR constellation will be positioned in the same orbital plane with a phasing outlined in Table 2. The nominal repeat cycle is 16 days; however, each single satellite will have a near revisit time of 5 days.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">NOAA-3 was launched in November 1973 and was one in a series of
reconfigured ITOS satellites launched with new meteorological sensors
onboard to expand the operational capability of the ITOS system.  The
primary objective was to provide global daytime and nighttime direct
readout real-time cloudcover data on a daily basis. The
sun-synchronous spacecraft was also capable of supplying global
atmospheric temperature soundings and very high resolution infrared
cloudcover data for selected areas in either a direct readout or a
tape-recorder mode. A secondary objective was to obtain global
solar-proton flux data on a real-time daily basis. The sensors were
mounted on the satellite baseplate with their optical axes directed
vertically earthward. The nearly cubical spacecraft measured 1 by 1 by
1.2 m. The satellite was equipped with three curved solar panels that
were folded during launch and deployed after orbit was achieved. Each
panel measured over 4.2 m in length when unfolded and was covered with
approximately 3500 solar cells measuring 2 by 2 cm. The dynamics and
attitude control system maintained desired spacecraft orientation
through gyroscopic principles incorporated into the satellite
design. Earth orientation of the satellite body was maintained by
taking advantage of the precession induced from a momentum flywheel so
that the satellite body precession rate of one revolution per orbit
provided the desired 'earth-looking' attitude. Minor adjustments in
attitude and orientation were made by means of magnetic coils and by
varying the speed of the momentum flywheel.
The primary sensors consisted of a Very High Resolution Radiometer
(VHRR), Vertical Temperature Profile Radiometer (VTPR), and a Scanning
Radiometer (SR).  The spacecraft became the operational ITOS
spacecraft on March 19, 1974.  Operations terminated in August 1976.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">     The Nimbus Technology satellite program was initiated by NASA in the early
1960's to develop an observational system capable of meeting the research and
development needs of Earth scientists.  The objectives of the program were to:
develop advanced passive radiometric and spectrometric sensors for surveillance
of the atmosphere and oceans; develop and evaluate new active and passive
sensors for sounding the atmosphere and for mapping surface characteristics;
develop advaced space technology and ground data processing techniques for
meteorological and scientific research; and participate in global observation
programs such as the World Weather Watch (WWW).  Eight spacecraft were built, of
which 7 were launched, with one failure, between 1964 and 1978.  The Nimbus
satellites were placed in polar orbits and acquired global data twice every 24
hours.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">GeoEye-1, formerly known as OrbView-5, is the next-generation high-resolution imaging mission of GeoEye, Dulles, VA, USA. In January 2006, the commercial imaging company GeoEye was formed, made up of former Orbimage of Dulles VA, and of former Space Imaging of Thornton, CO (Orbimage acquired Space Imaging in 2005 and gave the merged company the new name of GeoEye). The newly formed GeoEye company is the world's largest commercial satellite imagery provider.

On Sept. 30, 2004, OrbImage was awarded a NextView vendor contract of NGA (National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency). The contract, referred to as NextView OrbImage, provides long-term revenue commitments as well as capital for the development of OrbView-5. NGA's NextView program is designed to give US commercial imaging satellite operators the financing to build their satellites for high-resolution imaging.

GeoEye's principal partners for the development and launch of the GeoEye-1 satellite include General Dynamics (formerly Spectrum Astro), ITT Industries (imager), and Boeing Launch Services. GeoEye's partners for the ground segment include IBM and MDA (MacDonald, Dettwiler and Associates) of Richmond, BC, Canada.

he GeoEye-1 spacecraft is being designed and developed at General Dynamics/C4 Systems of Gilbert, AZ (formerly Spectrum Astro) as prime contractor. The contract was award in Dec. 2004. The spacecraft design is based on the SA-200HP standard modular bus (of Coriolis and SWIFT heritage). The spacecraft is 3-axis stabilized with a sophisticated attitude control system to provide a highly stable, while also highly agile imaging platform.

A body-pointing capability of up to ± 60º is being provided, made possible by enhanced reaction wheels (low jitter). The image geolocation accuracy is ≤ 3 m. The spacecraft mass is 1955 kg (bus mass = 1260 kg), the S/C design is fully redundant with an operational life of 7 years (the expected life is 10 years).

Orbit: Sun-synchronous circular orbit, altitude = 684 km, inclination = 98º, period = 98 minutes, local equatorial crossing at 10:30 hours, effective revisit time capability ≤ 3 days.

Launch: A launch of GeoEye-1 is scheduled for August 2008 on a Delta-2 (7420-10) vehicle from VAFB, CA. The launch provider is ULA (United Launch Alliance). The launch delay from the fall of 2007 is due to a launch congestion at VAFB.

RF communications: The source data are being stored on solid-state onboard recorders of 1.2 Tbit capacity. The downlink of imagery in X-band at 740 Mbit/s (or at 150 Mbit/s), the TT&amp;C data are in S-band. The S/C is being operated from the command and control facility at GeoEye headquarters in Dulles, VA, along with an imagery acquisition station. Three other acquisition stations will be operated or leased by GeoEye in Barrow, AK, Tromsø, Norway and Troll, Antarctica (the TrollSat station is located at 72º S and 2º E). The latter two stations are being leased from KSAT (Kongsberg Satellite Services) of Tromsø, Norway.
A total of four stations are needed to handle primary data reception due to the large volume of data that will be captured by the satellite. In addition, GeoEye will continue to support a network of receiving stations owned and operated by local business partners, referred to as Regional Affiliates and Regional Distributors.

Ground segment: GeoEye has built a fully integrated receiving, processing, and distribution network for delivering high-quality imagery products to customers around the world.

In late 2006, GeoEye purchased high-bandwidth, high-performance compute technology from SGI (Silicon Graphics Inc.). Four SGI Altix systems were installed at the Dulles (VA) ground station for data processing, distribution, and archiving services.

Sensor complement: (GIS)

The requirements of GeoEye-1 call for panchromatic imagery with a resolution of 0.41 m and multispectral imagery with a resolution of 1.64 m. The imager is being designed and developed by ITT Space Systems Division, formerly Kodak Remote Sensing Systems of Rochester, New York, which built also the sensor for Ikonos-2 (launch April 27, 1999). In January 2007, the GeoEye-1 imager system was delivered to General Dynamics for integration into the spacecraft.

GIS (GeoEye Imager System). GIS is a pushbroom imaging system whose basic elements are the optics subsystem (telescope assembly), the focal plane assembly (CCD detector), and the digital electronics subsystem. The optics subsystem employs a TMA (Three Mirror Anastigmatic) telescope design with a primary mirror aperture of 1.1 m in diameter. Three mirrors are used to image and focus the light, and two additional mirrors to direct the image to the FPA (Focal Plane Assembly). The telescope is designed to give a near-perfect (diffraction limited) image to the FPA and to convert the analog pixels into digitized signals.

The FPA consists of an array of CCD detectors with 8 µm pixel size for PAN and 32 µm pixel size for multispectral imagery. ITT has included an outer barrel and door assembly to help protect the telescope and maintain its thermal environment.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Orbiting Solar Observatory - 1 (OSO-1) Engineering Prototype

The Orbiting Solar Observatory (OSO) series was the earliest of
the spin stabilized scientific satellites. OSO-1 was launched
on March 7, 1962 to study the sun in the ultraviolet, x-ray and
gamma-ray regions of the spectrum. Sun sensors connected to
servo-feedback systems on the upper "sail" portion were
designed to keep the pointed instruments (75 pound payload) to
within +/- 1 minute of arc on the center of the sun. The lower
spinning portion carried some 100 pounds of instruments and
rotated once every two seconds, allowing those instruments to
scan the solar disk and atmosphere. The OSO had three
protruding arms that extended after deployment which gave the
system greater axial stability. Among many observations by the
battery of instruments on OSO was that the sun's corona had
openings, now called coronal holes, which were interpreted as
huge fast-moving bubbles rising through the corona. Ball
Aerospace Systems Division restored the OSO-I engineering
prototype in 1982 af ter it was transferred from NASA in 1981.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">TIROS-N was launched in October 1978 and was a third generation
operational meteorological satellite for use in the National
Operational Environmental Satellite System (NOESS) and for the support
of the Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP) during 1978-84.  The
satellite design provided an economical and stable sun-synchronous
platform for advanced operational instruments to measure the earth's
atmosphere, its surface and cloud cover, and the near-space
environment.  The satellite was based upon the Block 5D spacecraft bus
developed for the U.S. Air Force, and it was capable of maintaining an
earth-pointing accuracy of better than plus or minus 0.1 degree with a
motion rate of less than 0.035 degree/second.
Primary sensors included an Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
(AVHRR) and a TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS). Secondary
experiments consisted of a Space Environment Monitor (SEM) and a Data
Collection System (DCS).

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Scientists around the world will be provided a unique vantage point for studying how the Earth's global environment is changing when Space Shuttle Endeavour is launched on Shuttle mission STS-59. During the 9-day mission, the Space Radar Laboratory (SRL) payload in Endeavour's cargo bay will give scientists highly detailed information that will help them distinguish human-induced environmental changes from other natural forms of change.

The Space Radar Laboratory (SRL) payload is comprised of the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) and the Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellite (MAPS). The German Space Agency (DARA) and the Italian Space Agency (ASI) are providing the X-SAR instrument. 

The imaging radar of the SIR-C/X-SAR instruments have the ability to make measurements over virtually any region at any time, regardless of weather or sunlight conditions. The radar waves can penetrate clouds, and under certain conditions, can also "see" through vegetation, ice and extremely dry sand. In many cases, radar is the only way scientists can explore inaccessible regions of the Earth's surface.

The Japanese Marine Observation Satellite-1b (MOS-1b) was the second
Earth resources satellite in the MOS series to be launched by NASDA to
monitor atmospheric water vapor, ocean currents, sea surface
temperature, ice floe dynamics, chlorophyll concentration in the
oceans, and vegetation and agricultural land applications. The MOS-1b
carried the same three sensors as the MOS-1a: a Multi-spectrum
Electronic Self-Scanning Radiometer (MESSR), a Visible and Thermal
Infrared Radiometer (VTIR), and a Microwave Scanning Radiometer
(MSR). Data was transmitted real-time to the Hatoyama Earth
Observation Center for processing and is available through the Data
Service Department, Remote Sensing Technology Center of Japan
(RESTEC). The satellite also included a Data Collection System (DCS)
Transponder designed to be a forerunner of the Japanese TDRSS, used to
collect and relay information from surface Data Collection Platforms
(DCPs) and locate DCPs based on the Doppler frequency of received
signals. The satellite is a 1.26 x 1.48 x 2.4 meter high box-shape of
aluminium honeycomb construction with a single solar array of three
1.51 meter wide panels. The satellite is controlled in three axes by
momentum wheels and four IN hydrazine thrusters. Other MOS satellites
are planned throughout the 1990's.

Spot 5 is a French (CNES), Earth-imaging, three tonne satellite that was launched by an Ariane 42P rocket from Kourou at 00:31:00 UT on 4 May 2002. Its planar and stereoscopic relief images at about three meter resolution will be marketed for civilian and military uses, for cartographic and vegetation analyses. Panchromatic (at 2.5 m resolution) as well as multispectral images (at 10 m resolution) could be obtained. The position of the satellite, and hence the location of the images could be determined at 15 m accuracy by means of the DORIS position determination instrument. Extensive information on the instruments and data products is available via http://www.spotimage.com/

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">SNOE ("snowy") was a small scientific satellite that measured the effects of energy from the sun and from the magnetosphere on the density of nitric oxide in the Earth's upper atmosphere. The spacecraft and its instruments were designed and built at LASP, the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado, Boulder. SNOE was launched on February 26, 1998, and was operated from the mission operations center at the LASP Space Technology Research building. SNOE re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on Dec. 13, 2003, completing a very successful mission. This site contains a description of the SNOE mission, spacecraft drawings and images, and provides access to the scientific data and publications. An archive of launch activities and development personnel have been retained.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The IRIS Global Seismographic Network (GSN) is one of the four major components
of the IRIS Consortium. The goal of the GSN is to deploy 128 permanent seismic
recording stations uniformly over the earth's surface.

Stations:

As of 2003 the IRIS GSN was made up of over 128 stations with affiliations to
USGS, UCSD/IDA, GEOFON, Pacific21, NCDSN, GEOSCOPE, MedNet, BGR, BFO, USNSN,
BDSN, TriNet, AFTAC and several other national and international networks.
Eight new stations are planned for completion in 2003-2005.

The IRIS GSN stations continuously record seismic data from very broad band
seismometers at 20 samples per second, and to provide for high-frequency (40
sps) and strong-motion (1 and 100 sps) sensors where scientifically warranted.
It is also the goal of the GSN to provide for real-time access to its data via
Internet or satellite. Over 75% of the IRIS GSN stations meet this goal.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Explorer 24 was placed in orbit together with Explorer 25 from a single launch vehicle.  Explorer 24 was identical in configuration to the previously launched balloon satellites Explorer 9 and 19.  The spacecraft was 3.6 m in diameter, was built of alternating layers of aluminum foil and plastic film, and was covered uniformly with 5.1-cm white dots for thermal control.  It was designed to yield atmospheric density near perigee as a function of space and time from sequential observations of the sphere's position in orbit.  To facilitate ground tracking, the satellite carried a 136-MHz tracking beacon.  The satellite reentered the earth's atmosphere on October 18, 1968.

SeaSoar is a a towed, undulating measurement package. The
moveable wings are contolled by a topside computer which sends
up-down signals via the conducting tow cable. The wings are moved
by a hydraulic unit which is powered by an impeller on the tail
of SeaSoar. Data is returned to a topside computer network via
the conducting cable.

experiments above the atmosphere during a complete solar cycle and to map the
celestial sphere for direction and intensity of UV light, X-rays, and gamma
radiation. The OSO 1 was the first satellite to have pointed instruments and
onboard tape recorders for data storage.  The OSO 1 platform consisted of a
sail section, which pointed two experiments continuously toward the sun,
supplying power to the experiments from the solar batteries and rechargeable
chemical batteries; and a wheel section, which spun about an axis perpendicular
to the pointing direction of the sail and carried seven experiments. Attitude
adjustment was performed by gas jets. Data were simultaneously recorded on tape
and transmitted by FM telemetry. A command system provided for 10 ground-based
commands. The spacecraft performed normally until the second onboard tape
recorder failed May 15, 1962. The spacecraft provided real-time data until May
1964, when the power cells failed.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Rockwell Aero Commander (AC-500S) is a versatile and stable high-winged twin piston-engine aircraft that is suitable for a variety of missions. Standard configuration allows for mission equipment and two pilots. However, with the scientific packages removed, seating for five additional passengers may be installed. NOAA's two aero commanders are utilized primarily as aerial survey platforms for visual verification of aeronautical charts, high-resolution aerial photography, and snow water equivalent and soil moisture content measurements. Additionally, the aircraft has been used in biological investigations, such as algal bloom measurements and sea turtle population assessments, and post-hurricane and severe flood damage assessment photography.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">DEIMOS satellite will be integrated into the international constellation DMC (Disaster Monitoring Constellation), which is composed of satellites from the UK, China, Nigeria, Algeria and Turkey. The combined use of the constellation satellites provides a unique capacity for Earth Observation, with more than one daily image of any place in the world.

The DMC is a unique international collaboration of member nations and, through this satellite, Spain joins the existing countries in the consortium (Algeria, China, Nigeria, Turkey and the UK). Each member of the consortium owns and operates a satellite whilst co-operating with the other members of the consortium. The model of co-operation has significant benefits – it allows information generated on-board one satellite to be used by other members of the consortium.

Deimos is a small earth observation satellite, which was built by SSTL to be ready for launch in the fourth quarter of 2008 and will form part of the Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC). The satellite will provide imagery for commercial applications, for government use and for rapid-response following disasters.

This contract with SSTL will provide Deimos with an enhanced version of the DMC wide area imaging system. The new system will image 600km wide swaths of the Earth in three spectral bands at a ground resolution of 22 meters, rather than using the standard 32m DMC imager. The contract also covers the provision of the ground system to allow operation of the satellite from Valladolid, Spain and it establishes SSTL as the launch agent for procurement of launch services.

This contract is Deimos' first step into satellite ownership. Since it was formed in 2001, Deimos has grown rapidly to become one of Europe's leading Space consultancies with over 200 staff. 

Deimos-1 has very advanced technology, in spite of its only 100 kg weight, that allows it to achieve the following characteristics:

    * 6 cameras in red, green and near infrared bands, equivalent to Landsat
    * High Spatial Resolution (20m)
    * Wide field of view (600 km)
    * High capacity for repeated imaging

The data processing and storage system boasts a capacity of 4 GB and a high processing speed.  This allows the satellite to obtain real-time data and send them to the Ground Station at a speed of 20 Mbps.  High-efficiency solar panels provide electric power in any orientation relative to the Sun.

The sustainable capacity of the system is 3 million km2 per day, and it can be used more intensively in case of necessity by waiting for some time between intensive zones for the battery to fully recharge.  A weekly coverage of the Iberian Peninsula can be obtained, or alternatively a bi-weekly coverage of the whole of Europe; in this way, new possibilities for regular remote sensing services open up.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The purpose of the AEROS spacecraft mission was to study the state and
behavior of the upper atmosphere (thermosphere) and the ionospheric F-region.
Of particular interest was the influence of solar ultraviolet radiation
on the structure, photochemistry and dynamics of the atmosphere above
100 km altitude.

INSTRUMENTATION:  Five experiments provided data on the temperature
and density of F-region electrons, ions and neutral particles, on the
composition of ions and neutral particles, and on the solar ultraviolet
flux incident on the topside ionosphere.

SPACECRAFT:  The AEROS satellite had a circular cylindrical shape
with a diameter of 0.914 meter and a height of 0.710 meter.

ORBIT:  AEROS was launched into an elliptical, polar, and nearly
sun-synchronous earth orbit.  The spacecraft was spin stabilized at
10 rpm and was oriented with the spin axis toward the sun.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The SOHO (Solar &amp; Heliospheric Observatory) project is being carried out by the
European Space Agency (ESA) and the US National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA) as a cooperative effort between the two agencies in the
framework of the Solar Terrestrial Science Program (STSP) comprising SOHO and
CLUSTER, and the International Solar-Terrestrial Physics Program (ISTP), with
Geotail (ISAS-Japan), Wind, and Polar.

SOHO was launched on December 2, 1995. The SOHO spacecraft was
built in Europe by an industry team led by Matra, and
instruments were provided by European and American
scientists. There are nine European Principal Investigators
(PI's) and three American ones. Large engineering teams and more
than 200 co-investigators from many institutions supported the
PI's in the development of the instruments and in the
preparation of their operations and data analysis. NASA was
responsible for the launch and is now responsible for mission
operations. Large radio dishes around the world which form
NASA's Deep Space Network are used to track the spacecraft
beyond the Earth's orbit. Mission control is based at Goddard
Space Flight Center in Maryland.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Skylab (SL) was a manned, orbiting spacecraft composed of five parts: the Apollo telescope mount (ATM), the multiple docking adapter (MDA), the airlock module (AM), the instrument unit (IU), and the orbital workshop (OWS).

The Skylab was in the form of a cylinder, with the ATM being positioned 90 degrees from the longitudinal axis after insertion into orbit.  The ATM was a solar observatory, and it provided attitude control and experiment pointing for the rest of the cluster.  The retrieval and installation of film used in the ATM was accomplished by astronauts during extravehicular activity (EVA).  The MDA served as a dock for the command and service modules, which served as personnel taxies to the Skylab.

The OWS was a modified Saturn 4B stage suitable for long duration manned habitation in orbit. It contained provisions and crew quarters necessary to support three-person crews for periods of up to 84 days each.  All parts were also capable of unmanned, in-orbit storage, reactivation, and reuse. The Skylab itself was launched on May 14, 1973.  It was first manned during the period May 25 to June 22, 1973, by the crew of the SL-2 mission.  Next, it was manned during the period July 28 to September 25, 1973, by the crew of the SL-3 mission. The final manned period was from November 16, 1973, to February 8, 1974, when it was manned by the crew from the SL-4 mission.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Space Transport System STS-62


Mission Objectives:

The 14-day mission is the latest in a series of Extended
Duration Orbiter (EDO) flights which will provide additional
information for on-going medical studies that assess the impact
of long-duration spaceflight, 10 or more days, on astronaut
health, identify any operational medical concerns and test
countermeasures for the adverse effects of weightlessness on
human physiology.

The United States Microgravity Payload (USMP) will be making its
second flight aboard the Space Shuttle. The USMP flights are
regularly scheduled on Shuttle missions to permit scientists
access to space for microgravity and fundamental science
experiments which cannot be duplicated on Earth and provide the
foundation for advanced scientific investigations that will be
done on the international space station.

The Office of Aeronautics and Space Technology (OAST-2) payload
contains six experiments that will obtain technology data to
support future needs for advanced satellites, sensors,
microcircuits and the space station. Data gathered by the OAST-2
experiments could lead to satellites and spacecraft that are
cheaper, more reliable and able to operate more efficiently.

STS-62 will help scientists calibrate sensitive ozone- detecting
instruments with the sixth flight of the Shuttle Solar
Backscatter Ultraviolet (SSBUV) Instrument. This highly
calibrated tool is used to check data from ozone-measuring
instruments on free-flying satellites -- NASA's Total Ozone
Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) and Upper Atmosphere Research
Satellite (UARS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration NOAA-9 and NOAA-11 satellites.

The Protein Crystal Growth (PCG) experiments and the Commercial
Protein Crystal Growth (CPCG) experiments aboard Columbia will
help scientists understand the growth of crystals to study the
complex molecular structures of important proteins. By knowing
the structure of specific proteins, scientists can design new
drug treatments for humans and animals and develop new or better
food crops.

NASA's efforts in the important field of biotechnology are
represented by the fourth flight of the Physiological Systems
Experiment which is designed to evaluate pharmaceutical,
agricultural or biotechnological products, and the first flight
of the Biotechnology Specimen Temperature Controller (BSTC),
designed to test the performance of a temperature control device
being developed for use with the Bioreactor, a cell- culture
growth device. Also flying again on the Shuttle is the
Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus (CGBA) payload which
will support more than 15 commercial life science investigations
that have application in biomaterials, biotechnology, medicine
and agriculture.

The Middeck 0-Gravity Dynamics Experiment (MODE) will make its
second flight on STS-62. MODE investigates how the microgravity
of space flight influences the behavior of large space
structures. The MODE test article can be configured in different
shapes typical of space structural forms-- the truss of a space
station, for example -- to help engineers develop and verify an
analytical modeling capability for predicting the linear and
nonlinear modal characteristics of space structures in a
microgravity environment. MODE also will gather force
measurements of nominal, crew-induced disturbance loads on the
Shuttle.

Astronauts will demonstrate a new magnetic end effector and
grapple fixture design for the Shuttle's Canadian-built robot
arm that engineers believe will increase the arm's dexterity and
alignment accuracy, provide operators with a sense of touch and
allow the use of more compact "handles" on satellites and other
Shuttle payloads.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The University of North Dakota owns and operates a Cessna Citation II aircraft for the purpose of atmospheric research. This aircraft type has a number of design and performance characteristics that make it an ideal platform for a wide range of atmospheric studies. The Citation II is a twin-engine fanjet with an operating ceiling of 43,000 feet (13.1 km). The turbofan engines provide sufficient power to cruise at speeds of up to 340 knots (175 m s-1) or climb at 3300 feet per minute (16.8 m s-1). These high performance capabilities are accompanied by relatively low fuel consumption at all altitudes, giving the Citation an on-station time of 3-5 hours, depending on mission type. Long wings allow it to be operated out of relatively short airstrips and to be flown at the slower speeds (140 kts/72 m s-1) necessary for many types of measurements. The Citation is certified for flight into known icing conditions.

FedSat is an Australian scientific microsatellite mission, a
58cm cube weighing approximately 50 kg. It was launched in early
2002 from Japan by Japan's National Space Development Agency.

The purpose of FedSat is to:

Establish Australian capability in microsatellite technologies
Develop expertise necessary for sustaining those industries and
profiting from them

Test and develop Australian-developed intellectual property
Provide a research platform for Australian space science,
communication and GPS studies.

FedSat was developed by the Cooperative Research Centre for
Satellite Systems, which combines the resources and skills of 12
Australian organizations. Contributions from each of the partner
organizations are doubled by the Commonwealth Government, under
its Commonwealth Government's Cooperative Research Center?s
Program. The total budget of the Centre is approximately
&amp;#3660 million over 7 years, with &amp;#3620 million of that
allocated for the FedSat mission. Much of FedSat was developed
in Australia by the CRCSS. Three of the six main payloads have
been fully developed by the CRCSS, and the other three have been
supplied by overseas organizations in consultation with the
CRCSS.  The satellite platform, the structure that houses and
maintains the payloads, is being provided by overseas
organizations. CRCSS engineers could have developed an
Australian platform, but given the time available from
project-start to launch, that was not practical. CRCSS opted to
contract an overseas platform supplier, avoiding the need to
reinvent established technologies.  Payloads:

1. GPS Receiver: The GPS, Global Positioning System, is an
American network of satellites that transmit radio signals
containing time and orbit-position codes. GPS receivers decode
the signals, and by comparing signals of up to 4 satellites with
known positions, they can derive their own locations by
triangulation. The system was designed for mainly military use,
but now GPS provides many scientific and civilian applications.

2. NewMag: The NewMag magnetometer is a very sensitive and
rapid-sampling device for measuring the strength of the Earth's
magnetic field. Earth is like a big bar magnet, with magnetic
field lines emerging from the poles and far out into
space. FedSat's polar orbit crosses all these lines, so NewMag
can effectively gain a window into the whole magnetosphere
region. NewMag can also measure vibrations simultaneously with
ground- based magnetometers, so investigating the dynamics of
the magnetosphere (changes in it shape due to variations in the
Sun), and study magnetospheric wave-propagation.

3. High performance computing: The FedSat high performance
computing payload is the world's first use of reconfigurable
computing technology in space. Reconfigurable computers permit
change of their physical circuits via software control; new
physical circuits can be installed into a reconfigurable
computer module by remote command. For spacecraft, this
technology means that satellites can be rewired without having
to retrieve them.

4. Ka-band transponder: The FedSat Ka-band transponder is
designed to handle the new experimental high- frequency and
high-capacity Ka part of the radio spectrum. The transponder
processes signals to and from the ground in the frequency
band. The transponder incorporates CRCSS-designed Gallium
Arsenide monolithic microwave circuits; FedSat will space
qualify these for the first time.

5. Baseband processor The baseband processor provides on-board
computer processing of the Ka- and UHF- band payloads. It has
been designed and built by the CRCSS, to operate as a low power
single modem with flexible operation. It will also provide the
channel for satellite operations commands.

6. UHF communications payload: The Ultra High Frequency band
payload will introduce a new type of packet data service for Low
Earth Orbiting satellites to obtain environmental data. For
example, ocean buoys may transmit their data using this means to
orbiting satellites, which are retransmitted back to the lab for
analysis.

7. CD ROM: FedSat also carries a compact disc mounted on the
side, containing the audio messages members of the Australian
public recorded to go into space from March to August 2000. The
disc also contains a copy of the song From Little Things, Big
Things Grow, by Paul Kelly, with kind permission of the writers
(Kev Carmody/Paul Kelly) and publishers (Larrikin Music,
Mushroon Records).

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">MAXIS (MeV Auroral X-ray Imaging and Spectroscopy):

Launched: January 12, 2000

Purpose of Flight:

To study electron precipitation from the magnetosphere into the
ionosphere. This electron precipitation creates the aurora
(northern and southern lights) along with X-rays which can be
observed with our balloon instrumentation. For this project, the
University of Washington provided a bismuth germanate (BGO)
X-ray spectrometer and two X-ray imaging cameras. One camera has
a pinhole collimator and the other has a coded aperture mask
collimator. Both cameras use scintillating crystals and
photomultiplier tubes to detect X-rays which are produced in the
aurora. The Berkeley balloon group provided a high resolution
germanium X-ray spectrometer. All of these instruments flew on
the INTERBOA campaign in 1996, where they observed an unusual
relativistic electron precipitation event.

The MAXIS balloon was terminated on January 30, 2000 at 22:13 UT
after a successful 450 hour flight.

Vanguard 2 was an earth-orbiting satellite designed to measure
cloud-cover distribution over the daylight portion of its orbit. The
spacecraft was a 9.8 kg magnesium sphere 50.8 cm in diameter. It
contained two optical telescopes with two photocells. The sphere was
internally gold-plated and externally covered with an aluminum deposit
coated with silicon oxide of sufficient thickness to provide thermal
control for the instrumentation. Radio communication was provided by a
1-W, 108.03-MHz telemetry transmitter and a 10-mW, 108-MHz beacon
transmitter that sent a continuous signal for tracking purposes. A
command receiver was used to activate a tape recorder that relayed
telescope experiment data to the telemetry transmitter. Both
transmitters functioned normally for 19 days. The satellite was spin
stabilized at 50 rpm, but telemetry data were poor because of an
unsatisfactory orientation of the spin axis. The power supply for the
instrumentation was provided by mercury batteries.

Vanguard 3 was launched by a Vanguard rocket from the Eastern Test
Range into a geocentric orbit. The objectives of the flight were to
measure the earth's magnetic field, the solar X-ray radiation and its
effects on the earth's atmosphere, and the near-earth micrometeoroid
environment. Instrumentation included a proton magnetometer, X-ray
ionization chambers, and various micrometeoroid detectors. The
spacecraft was a 50.8-cm-diameter magnesium sphere. The magnetometer
was housed in a glass fiber phenolic resin conical tube attached to
the sphere. Data transmission stopped on December 11, 1959, after 84
days of operation. The data obtained provided a comprehensive survey
of the earth's magnetic field over the area covered, defined the lower
edge of the Van Allen radiation belt, and provided a count of
micrometeoroid impacts.  Vanguard 3 has an expected orbital lifetime
of 300 yr.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">ATS 4 was launched in August 1968 and was a gravity-gradient-stabilized
spacecraft designed to (1) test new concepts in spacecraft design, propulsion,
and stabilization, (2) take high-quality cloud cover pictures, (3) provide in
situ measurements of the aerospace environment, and (4) test improved
communication systems while in earth-synchronous orbit.  The
cylindrically-shaped spacecraft measured 142 cm in diameter and 183 cm in
length.  The primary structural members were a corrugated thrust tube with
honeycombed bulkheads secured to each end.  Equipment components and payload
were externally mounted on the outer surface of the thrust tube as well as on a
structure that slid into the interior of the thrust  tube.  Electric power was
provided by two solar arrays mounted on either end of the spacecraft's outer
shell and by two rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries.  Extending radially
outward from the side of the spacecraft were four 28.2 m adjustable
gravity-gradient booms.   The spacecraft telemetry system consisted of four
2.1-W transmitters, (two at 136.47 MHz and two at 137.35 MHz), in addition to a
microwave  communications  experiment.

This satellite featured an image orthicon (day/night) camera for the purpose of
determining the feasibility of simultaneous day/night imaging of cloud cover
patterns from an earth-synchronous spacecraft.  The second stage of the launch
vehicle failed to to ignite, and the planned synchronous orbit was not
achieved.  The spacecraft and its Centaur booster rocket were left attached
together in a parking orbit. In spite of the anomalistic attitude, some of the
experiments did perform successfully before the satellite and its attached
rocket booster reentered the earth's atmosphere on October 17, 1968.  The
primary objective of inserting a gravity-gradient-stabilized spacecraft into a
geosynchronous orbit was not accomplished.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Atlantis will put NASA's fourth Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS-E) into orbit on Space Shuttle mission STS-43 to update the satellite tracking network, resulting in two operating satellites plus a complement of two spares in the space network.

TDRS-E, to be deployed from Atlantis about 6 hours after launch, will be boosted to a geosynchronous orbit by an attached upper stage where TDRS-E will be positioned to remain stationary 22,400 miles above the Pacific Ocean southwest of Hawaii.

The Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System, in operation since the eighth Space Shuttle flight, provides almost uninterrupted communications with Earth-orbiting shuttles and satellites and has replaced the intermittent coverage provided by globe-encircling ground tracking stations used during the early space program.  A reduced string of ground stations remains in operation, however, for radar tracking and backup communications.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The AEROS 2 satellite had a cylindrical shape, a diameter of 0.914 m, and a height of 0.710 m. It was launched into an elliptical, polar, nearly sun-synchronous earth orbit. The spacecraft was spin-stabilized at 10 rpm and oriented with the spin axis toward the sun. The purpose of the mission was to study the state and behavior of the upper atmosphere and ionospheric F region, especially with regard to the influence of the solar ultraviolet radiation. Five experiments provided data which included the temperature and density of electrons, ions, and neutral particles, the composition of ions and neutral particles, and solar ultraviolet flux.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The SPOT-3 (Satellite Pour l'Observation de la Terre) spacecraft was
launched in September 26,1993.  SPOT-3 is a earth observation
satellite with a ground resolution better than that of the Landsat
series satellites. The main applications for the images returned by
the third SPOT mission are land-use studies, agriculture and forestry
resources, mineral and oil resources, and cartography. The three-axis
stabilized satellite operates in a circular sun-synchronous near-polar
orbit for a design lifetime of 2 years.

Orbital Characteristics-
        Orbital Period:  101.20 m
        Inclination:  98.60 degrees
        Periapsis:    819.00 km              Apoapsis:  846.00 km

The spacecraft dimensions are 2 x 2 x 3.5 m and 15.60 m for the
overall length of the deployed solar panel. SPOT-3 consists of two
parts: (1) the bus, a standard multipurpose platform, and (2) the
payload. The bus provides housekeeping information and an onboard
computer. The payload is mounted on one of the side panels of the
bus. It consists of two identical high-resolution visible (HRV)
imaging instruments and a package comprising two magnetic-tape data
recorders and a telemetry transmitter. The HRV imaging instrument
observes in three spectral bands (in the visible and near infrared
regions) with a ground resolution of 20 m, and/or in a broader
spectral band (panchromatic black and white) with a ground resolution
of 10 m. The pattern of successive ground tracks is repeated exactly
at 26-day intervals. The SPOT-3 instrument package has the provision
for off-nadir viewing which should be particularly useful for
monitoring localized phenomena evolving on a relatively short
timescale. Also, the satellite provides the capability for recording
stereoscopic pairs of images of a given area during successive
satellite passes.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Meteosat-P2 (Meteosat 3) was launched on June 15, 1988 from Kourou,
French Guiana.  Meteosat 3 is a refurbished protoype of Meteosat-2.
In general, the design, the instrumentation, and the operation are
similar to SMS/GOES.  The cylindrically shaped spacecraft measures 210
cm in diameter and 430 cm in length, including the apogee boost motor.
The primary structural members are an equipment platform and a central
tube. The radiometer telescope is mounted on the equipment platform
and views the earth through a special aperture in the side of the
spacecraft.  A support structure extends radially out from the central
tube and is affixed to the solar panels, which form the outer walls of
the spacecraft. These solar panels provide the primary source of
electrical power.  Located in the annulus-shaped space between the
central tube and the solar panels are station-keeping and dynamics
control equipment and batteries. Proper spacecraft attitude and spin
rate (approximately 100 rpm) are maintained by jet thrusters mounted
on the spacecraft and activated by ground command. The spacecraft uses
both UHF-band and S-band frequencies in the telemetry and command
systems.  During launch, a lower power VHF transponder provides
telemetry and command.  After launch, the VHF transponder then serves
as a backup for the primary subsystem once the spacecraft attains
synchronous orbit.

The spin-stabilized, geostationary spacecraft carries (1) a visible-IR
radiometer to provide high-quality, day/night cloud-cover data and to
take radiance temperatures of the earth/atmosphere system, and (2) a
meteorological data collection system to disseminate image data to
user stations, to collect data from various earth-based platforms, and
to relay data from polar-orbiting satellites.  Orbital

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Global Positioning System (GPS) Satellite is a system of satellites
developed by the US Department of Defense to provide all-weather
round-the-clock navigation capabilities for military ground, sea, and air
forces. Since its implementation, GPS has also become an integral asset in
numerous civilian applications and industries around the globe, including
recreational uses (e.g. boating, aircraft, hiking), corporate vehicle fleet
tracking, and surveying.

GPS employs 24 spacecraft in 20,200 km circular orbits inclined at 55 degrees.
These spacecraft are placed in 6 orbit planes with four operational satellites
in each plane. All launches have been successful except for one launch failure
in 1981. The full 24-satellite constellation was completed on March 9, 1994.

GPS receivers use triangulation of the GPS satellites' navigational signals to
determine their location. The satellites provide two different signals that
provide different accuracies. Coarse-acquisition (C/A) code is intended for
civilian use, and is deliberately degraded. The accuracy using a typical
civilian GPS receiver with C/A code is typically about 100 meters. The
military's Precision (P) code is not corrupted, and provides positional
accuracy to within approximately 20 meters.

GOES 6 was launched in April 1983 and was a NASA-developed, NOAA-operated,
geosynchronous, and operational spacecraft.  The cylindrically shaped
spacecraft measured 190.5 cm in diameter and 230 cm in length, exclusive of a
magnetometer that extended an additional 83 cm beyond the cylinder shell. The
primary structural members were a honeycombed equipment shelf and thrust tube.
The VISSR telescope was mounted on the equipment shelf and viewed the Earth
through a special aperture in the side of the spacecraft.  A support structure
extended radially out from the thrust tube and was affixed to the solar panels,
which formed the outer walls of the spacecraft and provided the primary source
of electrical power.  Located in the annulus-shaped space between the thrust
tube and the solar panels were stationkeeping and dynamics control equipment,
batteries, and most of the SEM equipment.  Proper spacecraft attitude and spin
rate (approximately 100 rpm) were maintained by two separate sets of jet
thrusters mounted around the spacecraft equator and activated by ground
command.  The spacecraft used both UHF-band and S-band frequencies in its
telemetry and command subsystem.  A low-power VHF transponder provided
telemetry and command during launch and then served as a backup for the primary
subsystem once the spacecraft attained orbit.

The spin-stabilized spacecraft carried a visible infrared spin-scan radiometer
atmospheric sounder, meteorological data collection and transmission system,
space environment monitor, and a biaxial fluxgate magnetometer.  GOES 6 was
moved from its 135 degrees West position to a more central 98 degrees West
position when GOES 5 failed on July 29, 1984.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Fokker F27 Friendship is a turboprop airliner designed and built by the Dutch aircraft manufacturer Fokker.

Design of the Fokker F27 started in the 1950s as a replacement to the successful DC-3 airliner. The manufacturer evaluated a number of different configurations before finally deciding on a high wing twin Rolls-Royce Dart engine layout with a pressurised cabin for 28 passengers.

The first prototype, registered PH-NIV, first flew on 24 November 1955. The second prototype and initial production machines were 3 ft (0.9 m) longer, addressing the first aircraft's slightly tail-heavy handling and also providing space for more (32) passengers. These aircraft also used the more powerful Dart Mk 528 engine. The first production model, the F27-100, was delivered to Aer Lingus in September 1958.

In 1956 Fokker signed a licensing deal with the US aircraft manufacturer Fairchild for the latter to construct the F27 in the USA. The first U.S.-built aircraft flew on 12 April 1958. Fairchild also independently developed a stretched version, called the FH-227.

At the end of the Fokker F27s production in 1987, 793 units had been built (including 207 in the USA by Fairchild), which makes it the most successful western European civil turboprop airliner.

Many aircraft have been modified from passenger service to cargo or express-package freighter roles.

In the early 1980s, Fokker developed a successor to the Friendship, the Fokker 50. Although based on the F27-500 airframe, the Fokker 50 is virtually a new aircraft with Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada engines and modern systems. Its general performance and passenger comfort were improved over the F27.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">STEREO (Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory) is a 2-year NASA mission employing two nearly identical space-based observatories to provide the very first, 3-D "stereo" images of the sun to study the nature of coronal mass ejections. These powerful solar eruptions are a major source of the magnetic disruptions on Earth and a key component of space weather, which can greatly affect satellite operations, communications, power systems, the lives of humans in space, and global climate.

STEREO is the third mission in NASA's Solar Terrestrial Probes Program. The twin observatories launched aboard a single Boeing Delta II rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla., on Oct. 25, 2006, at 8:52 p.m. EDT.

STEREO is sponsored by NASA Headquarters' Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Solar Terrestrial Probes Program Office, in Greenbelt, Md., manages the mission, instruments and science center. The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), in Laurel, Md., designed and built the spacecraft and will operate the twin observatories for NASA during the mission. 

The two spacecraft are launched to drift slowly away from the Earth in opposite directions at about 10 degrees per year for the lagging spacecraft and 20 degrees per year for the leading one. Optimal longitudinal separation of about sixty degrees is achieved after two years. Afterwards the separation gradually increases beyond the design lifetime of two years with the possibility of extended mission observations at larger angles. Science instruments selected for STEREO include the Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (SECCHI) for extreme ultraviolet (EUV), white-light coronographic, and heliospheric imaging, the STEREO/WAVES (SWAVES) interplanetary radio burst tracker, the In situ Measurements of Particles and CME Transients (IMPACT) investigation for in-situ sampling the 3-D distribution and plasma characteristics of solar energetic particles and the interplanetary magnetic field, and the PLAsma and SupraThermal Ion and Composition (PLASTIC) experiment to measure elemental and charge composition of ambient and CME plasma ions. STEREO data recorded and stored onboard each spacecraft will be downlinked through the NASA Deep Space Network on a daily schedule. Real-time space weather data will be continuously transmitted through a separate beacon system to NASA and non-NASA receiving stations.

It also made measurements of the interplanetary medium during its cruise to Venus and after the flyby. 

Spacecraft and Subsystems 

Mariner 2 consisted of a hexagonal base, 1.04 meters across and 0.36 meters thick, which contained six magnesium chassis housing the electronics for the science experiments, communications, data encoding, computing, timing, and attitude control, and the power control, battery, and battery charger, as well as the attitude control gas bottles and the rocket engine. On top of the base was a tall pyramid-shaped mast on which the science experiments were mounted which brought the total height of the spacecraft to 3.66 meters. Attached to either side of the base were rectangular solar panel wings with a total span of 5.05 meters and width of 0.76 meters. Attached by an arm to one side of the base and extending below the spacecraft was a large directional dish antenna. 

The Mariner 2 power system consisted of the two solar cell wings, one 183 cm by 76 cm and the other 152 cm by 76 cm (with a 31 cm dacron extension (a solar sail) to balance the solar pressure on the panels) which powered the craft directly or recharged a 1000 Watt-hour sealed silver-zinc cell battery, which was used before the panels were deployed, when the panels were not illuminated by the Sun, and when loads were heavy. A power-switching and booster regulator device controlled the power flow. Communications consisted of a 3 Watt transmitter capable of continuous telemetry operation, the large high gain directional dish antenna, a cylindrical omnidirectional antenna at the top of the instrument mast, and two command antennas, one on the end of either solar panel, which received instructions for midcourse maneuvers and other functions. 

Propulsion for midcourse maneuvers was supplied by a monopropellant (anhydrous hydrazine) 225 N retro-rocket. The hydrazine was ignited using nitrogen tetroxide and aluminum oxide pellets, and thrust direction was controlled by four jet vanes situated below the thrust chamber. Attitude control with a 1 degree pointing error was maintained by a system of nitrogen gas jets. The Sun and Earth were used as references for attitude stabilization. Overall timing and control was performed by a digital Central Computer and Sequencer. Thermal control was achieved through the use of passive reflecting and absorbing surfaces, thermal shields, and movable louvers. 

The scientific experiments were mounted on the instrument mast and base. A magnetometer was attached to the top of the mast below the omnidirectional antenna. Particle detectors were mounted halfway up the mast, along with the cosmic ray detector. A cosmic dust detector and solar plasma spectrometer detector were attached to the top edges of the spacecraft base. A microwave radiometer and an infrared radiometer and the radiometer reference horns were rigidly mounted to a 48 cm diameter parabolic radiometer antenna mounted near the bottom of the mast. All instruments were operated throughout the cruise and encounter modes except the radiometers, which were only used in the immediate vicinity of Venus.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) was designed to provide coordinated
observations of solar activity, in particular solar flares, during a
period of maximum solar activity. The payload was made up of seven
instruments, specifically selected to study the short-wavelength and
coronal manifestations of flares. The total solar irradiance was
measured by ACRIM, gamma rays by GRS, hard X-rays by the HXRBS, soft
X-rays by XRP and HXIS, ultraviolet by UVSP, and the C/P imaged the
corona 2-5 radii from the sun. Data were obtained on the storage and
release of flare energy, particle acceleration, formation of hot
plasma, and mass ejection. Complementary studies were made as part of
the SMM guest investigator program, and coordinated in-situ
measurements of flare particle emissions were made from the ISEE-3
spacecraft.

The SMM observatory was of modular construction and measured
approximately 4 m in length, fitting into a circular envelope 2.3 m in
diameter. The instrument module occupied the top 2.3 m and contained
all the solar payload instruments together with the fine-pointing
Sun-sensor system. Below the instrument module was the Multimission
Modular Spacecraft (MMS) containing the systems for attitude control,
power, communication, and data handling. Between the instrument module
and the MMS was the transition adaptor, supporting two fixed solar
paddles that supplied between 1500 and 3000 W of power.
Quick and coordinated responses to solar flares were considered
essential for meeting the scientific objectives of the
mission. Therefore, the ground system was designed to facilitate
coordinated data evaluation, observation, planning, and command uplink
to the onboard stored command processor. Onboard coordination of
response to a flare was performed in real time. The attitude-control
software allowed observatory repointings and slow scanning motions;
there was also a special module for tracking a solar feature over many
days.

A repair mission by the space shuttle (STS-41C) was performed in
1984. During the repair mission the Shuttle astronauts rendezvoused
with SMM and replaced successfully some hardware. As a result the
coronagraph observations resumed until the end of mission.
SMM collected data until Nov. 24, 1989, and re-entered on Dec. 2, 1989.

26, 1973 to measure the magnetic fields, plasmas, and energetic charged
particles (e.g., cosmic rays) of the Earth's magnetotail and magnetosheath and
of the near-Earth solar wind. IMP-8, the last of ten IMP (Interplanetary

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The fourth in the IRS series, IRS - 1C was launched from Baikanur cosmodrome, Kazakhstan on May 19, 1995. It operates in a near polar, sun- synchronous orbit at an altitude of 817km. Its local equatorial crossing time is 10:30 A.M in the descending node. The satellite payload consists of three sensors, namely Panchromatic camera (PAN), Linear Imaging and Self-Scanning Sensor (LISS - III) and Wide Field Sensor (WiFS).

The PAN camera provides data with a spatial resolution of 5.8m and a ground swath of 70 km at nadir view. This camera can be steered up to +/- 26 degrees, which can be used to acquire stereo pairs and this also improves the revisit capability to 5 days.

LISS - III camera provides multi-spectral data in 4 bands. The spatial resolution for visible (two bands) and near infrared (one band) is 23.5m with a ground swath of 141 km. The fourth band (short wave infrared band) has a spatial resolution of 70.5m with a ground swath of 148 km. The repetivity of LISS - III is 24 days.

WiFS camera collects data in two spectral bands with a spatial resolution of 188m and a ground swath of 810 km. By virtue of its wide swath there is huge side lap between adjacent paths. A repetivity of 3 days can be achieved by suitably combining paths.

The satellite is equipped with an On Board Tape Recorder (OBTR) with a capacity of 62 Gb, for collecting data outside the visibility region of any ground station. The OBTR was capable of storing data collected for 24 minutes. The OBTR was functional during 1995-1998.

The STS-2 mission was planned as a five day mission, but was cut
nearly three days due to the failure of one of three fuel cells
that produce electricity and drinking water. However, 90 percent
of the mission objectives were still achieved.

The flight marked the first time a manned space vehicle had been
reflown with a second crew: Commander Joseph Engle and Pilot
Richard Truly. It again carried the Development Flight
Instrumentation (DFI) package , which contained sensors and
measuring devices to record orbiter performance and the stresses
that occurred during launch, ascent, orbital flight, descent and
landing. Also, onboard were the Office of Space and Terrestrial
Applications-1 (OSTA-1) Earth observation experiments mounted on
Spacelab pallet in payload bay. These instruments, including the
Shuttle Imaging Radar-A (SIR-1), successfully carried out remote
sensing of Earth resources, environmental quality, ocean and
weather conditions. In addition, the Canadian-built Remote

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">China began its geostationary meteorological satellite FY-2
program in 1980. Through hard work for more than ten years, the
first FY-2 satellite was launched on June 10, 1997 and located
in the geostationary orbit at an altitude of 35800 kilometers
over 105 degrees E. The satellite is a cylinder of 2.1 m by
1.6 m. The attitude of the satellite is spin stabilized with a
speed of 100 rotation/min.

FY-2A is the first geostationary meteorological satellite in
China. It is a spin-stabilized satellite. The main function of
FY-2A is observation. It takes visible, infrared and water vapor
disk images of the Earth hourly. The main payload of FY-2A is a
Visible and Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (VISSR).

The VISSR takes the Earth and cloud images from the space. A
complete 20° x20° scan covering the full Earth disk can be
accomplished every 30 minutes by means of combination of
satellite spin motion (100 rpm from the west to east) and step
action of the scan mirror (2500 steps from north to south). The
S-VISSR data are retransmitted to user stations via FY-2A during
the VISSR observation.  The stretched VISSR (S-VISSR) data are
the digital image data originated by VISSR on board and
stretched on the Command and Data Acquisition Station (CDAS) in
time. After stretching, the transmission rate of S-VISSR data is
reduced and can be easily received by the users.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The ALTUS II, the first of the two craft to be completed, made its first flight on May 1, 1996. With its engine at first augmented by a single-stage turbocharger, the ALTUS II reached an altitude of 37,000 ft during its first series of development flights at Dryden in August, 1996. In October of that year, the ALTUS II was flown in an Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM-UAV) study in Oklahoma conducted by Sandia National Laboratories for the Department of Energy (DOE). During the course of those flights, the ALTUS II set a single-flight endurance record for remotely operated aircraft of more than 26 hours.

The ALTUS I, completed in 1997, flew a series of development flights at Dryden that summer. Those test flights saw the craft reach an altitude of 43,500 ft while carrying a simulated 300-lb payload, a record for a remotely operated aircraft powered by a piston engine augmented with a single-stage turbocharger.

After major modifications and upgrades, including installation of a two-stage turbocharger in place of its original single-stage unit, a larger fuel tank and additional intercooling capacity, the ALTUS II returned to flight status in the summer of 1998. The goal of its development test flights was to reach one of the major Level 2 performance milestones within NASA's ERAST program: to fly a gasoline-fueled, piston-engine remotely piloted aircraft for several hours at an altitude at or near 60,000 feet. On March 5, 1999, The ALTUS II maintained flight at or above 55,000 feet for three hours, reaching a maximum density altitude of 57,300 feet during the mission.

Later that spring, the ALTUS II flew another series of Atmospheric Radiation Measurement missions conducted by Sandia National Laboratories for the DOE. Hard-to-measure properties of high-level cirrus clouds that may affect global warming were recorded using specially designed instruments while the Altus flew at 50,000 feet altitude off the Hawaiian island of Kaua'i. Clouds both reflect incoming solar energy back to space, and absorb warm longwave radiation from the Earth's surface, keeping that heat in the atmosphere. Data from the study will help scientists better understand how these dual roles of clouds in reflecting and absorbing solar energy work, and build more accurate global climate models.

In September, 2001, ALTUS II served as the UAV platform for a flight demonstration of remote sensoring and imaging capabilities that could detect hot spots in wildfires and relay that data in near- real time via the Internet to firefighting commanders below. The demonstration, led by NASA Ames Research Center, was flown over GA-ASI's El Mirage development facility in Southern California.

In the summer of 2002, The Altus II served as the airborne platform for the Altus Cumulus Electrification Study (ACES), led by Dr. Richard Blakeslee of NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. The ACES experiment focused on the collection of electrical, magnetic and optical measurements of thunderstorms. Data collected will help scientists understand the development and life cycles of thunderstorms, which in turn may allow meteorologists to more accurately predict when destructive storms may hit.

ICESat (Ice, Cloud,and land Elevation Satellite) is the benchmark Earth Observing System mission for measuring ice sheet mass balance, cloud and aerosol heights, as well as land topography and vegetation characteristics. The ICESat mission is providing multi-year elevation data needed to determine ice sheet mass balance as well as cloud property information, especially for stratospheric clouds which are common over polar areas. It will also provide topography and vegetation data around the globe, in addition to the polar-specific coverage over the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.

As envisioned by the Decadal Study, the ICESat-2 mission is to deploy an ICESat follow-on satellite to continue the assessment of polar ice changes. ICESat-2 is also expected to measure vegetation canopy heights, allowing estimates of biomass and carbon in above ground vegetation in conjunction with related missions, and allow measurements of solid earth properties. ICESat-2 is expected to launch in 2016.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">                  - Spacecraft Brief Description -
ISIS 2 was an ionospheric observatory instrumented with a sweep- and a
fixed-frequency ionosonde, a VLF receiver, energetic and soft particle
detectors, an ion mass spectrometer, an electrostatic probe, a retarding
potential analyzer, a beacon transmitter, a cosmic noise experiment, and two
photometers. Two long crossed-dipole antennas (73 and 18.7 m) were used for the
sounding, VLF, and cosmic noise experiments. The spacecraft was spin-stabilized
to about 2 rpm after antenna deployment. There were two basic orientation modes
for the spacecraft, cartwheel and orbit-aligned. The spacecraft operated
approximately the same length of time in each mode, remaining in one mode
typically 3 to 5 months. The cartwheel mode with the axis perpendicular to the
orbit plane was made available to provide ram and wake data for some
experiments for each spin period, rather than for each orbit period. Attitude
and spin information was obtained from a three-axis magnetometer and a sun
sensor. Control of attitude and spin was possible by means of magnetic
torquing. The experiment package also included a programmable tape recorder
with a 1-h capacity. For nonrecorded observations, data from satellite and
subsatellite regions were telemetered when the spacecraft was in the line of
sight of a telemetry station. Telemetry stations were located so that primary
data coverage was near the 80-deg-W meridian and near Hawaii, Singapore,
Australia, England, France, Norway, India, Japan, Antarctica, New Zealand, and
Central Africa. NASA support of the ISIS project was terminated on October 1,
1979. A significant amount of experimental data, however, was acquired after
this date by the Canadian project team. ISIS 2 operations were terminated in
Canada on March 9, 1984. The Radio Research Laboratories (Tokyo, Japan) then
requested and received permission to reactivate ISIS 2. Regular ISIS 2
operations were started from Kashima, Japan, in early August 1984. ISIS 2 was
deactivated effective 24, 1990.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Cessna Citation (CE-550) is a versatile twin-engine jet aircraft modified for acquiring remote sensing imagery. The aircraft is equipped with two equal sized camera ports which can support a wide variety of remote sensing configurations including large format aerial photography as well as data collection for digital cameras, hyperspectral, multispectral, and LIDAR systems.

Standard configuration includes space for two pilots, two equipment operators, and a scientific equipment rack. The aircraft can accommodate additional passengers depending on the amount of scientific equipment. The aircraft's unique side-by-side sensor port modification allows two different sensors to collect data simultaneously. The sensor ports have glass optical flats that allow the cabin to remain pressurized. Additionally, two high-precision GPS antennas provide signals to user receivers.

The Citation primarily supports the Remote Sensing Division of the National Geodetic Survey, collecting remote sensing data in support of coastal mapping and remote sensing research. Imagery acquired onboard the Citation is used for updating the shoreline and shore features on NOAA's nautical charts. The Citation also serves as an emergency responder during hurricane season by collecting digital photography of damaged areas caused by hurricane landfall.

The first satellite to be developed, CBERS-1, was launched with great success by the Chinese Long March 4B launcher, from the Taiyuan Launch Base, on Oct. 14, 1999. Launch occurred at 1:15 AM (Brasilia local time).

Two modules compose the satellite. The first one is the payload module, where 3 cameras are located (CCD Camera, IRMSS Camera and WFI Camera) and a Transponder for the Brazilian Environmental Data Collection System. The second one is the service module, containing the equipment for power supply, control, telecommunications and remaining functions necessary to the satellite operation.

Its orbit is Helios-synchronous, at a 778 km altitude. It performs about 14 revolutions a day and obtains a complete coverage of the Earth in 26 days.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The radiosonde is a balloon-borne instrument platform with radio transmitting capabilities. Originally named a radio-meteorograph, the instrument is now referred to as a radiosonde, a name apparently derived by H. Hergesell from a combination of the words "radio" for the onboard radio transmitter and "sonde", which is messenger from old English.

The radiosonde contains instruments capable of making direct in-situ measurements of air temperature, humidity and pressure with height, typically to altitudes of approximately 30 km. These observed data are transmitted immediately to the ground station by a radio transmitter located within the instrument package. The ascent of a radiosonde provides an indirect measure of the wind speed and direction at various levels throughout the troposphere. Ground based radio direction finding antenna equipment track the motion of the radiosonde during its ascent through the air. The recorded elevation and azimuth information are converted to wind speed and direction at various levels by triangulation techniques.

Numerous services of high strategic important and economic value are currently being provided based on data from the SPOT or Landsat series of satellites. The lifetime of SPOT-5 and Landsat is coming to an end. It is necessary to provide continuity and thus guarantee the availability of data to service providers and users. Enhancement as required by the growing user demand for higher service quality shall be considered. Action has to be started urgently as recognised also by ESA and EC, including the recent communication to European Parliament on Establishing a GMES Capacity by 2008.In addition, activities related to the accommodation of the IR sensor on Sentinel 2 will be added during the second part of the definition study.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
ODIN is a Swedish small satellite project for Astronomical and
Atmospheric Research. The Aeronomy research will address
scientific problem areas in the stratosphere and mesosphere by
making measurements of various trace species. The scientific
goals can be summarized as follows:

1. Stratospheric ozone science: To elucidate the geographical
extent of and mechanisms responsible for ozone depletion in the
"ozone hole" region and to study dilution effects and possible
heterogeneous chemistry even outside of the polar regions due to
sulphate aerosols

2. Mesospheric ozone science: To establish the relative role of
odd hydrogen chemistry and the effects of ordered and turbulent
transport and corpuscular radiation.

3. Summer mesospheric science: To establish the variability of
mesospheric water vapor including an assessment of the required
fluxes for aerosol formation in the polar mesosphere.

4. Coupling of atmospheric regions: To study some of the
mechanisms that provide coupling between the upper and lower
atmosphere, eg downward transport of aurorally enhanced NO with
its effects on ozone photo chemistry and the vertical exchange
of minor species such as odd oxygen, CO and H2O.

Odin will work in unexplored bands of the electromagnetic
spectrum, around wavelengths of 0.5 mm and 3 mm. These contain
emission lines from important molecules such as water vapor,
molecular oxygen, ozone and carbon monoxide. The lines will be
used as tools to study processes in the Earth's atmosphere and
in astronomical objects. Complementary information on the
atmosphere will come from spectral lines at ultraviolet and
optical wavelengths. Major scientific issues relate to star
formation processes interstellar chemistry and atmospheric ozone
balance.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">When the world's first jet airliner, the De Havilland Comet, was introduced in 1949, Douglas held a commanding position in the aircraft market. Although Boeing had pointed the way to the modern all-metal airliner in 1933 with the 247, it was Douglas that, more than any other company, made the promise a reality. Douglas produced a succession of piston-engined commercial aircraft through the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s: 138 DC-2s, 10,928 DC-3s (mostly for military service in World War II), 1453 DC-4s, 537 DC-6s and 226 DC-7s.

Given the success of their designs, Douglas took the view that there was no reason to rush into anything new, as did their rivals Lockheed and Convair. Most air transport manufacturers expected that there would be a gradual switch, from piston engines to turbines and that it would be to the more fuel-efficient turboprop engines rather than pure jets.

In contrast, Boeing took the bold step of starting to plan a pure jet airliner as early as 1949. Boeing's military arm had gained extensive experience with large, long-range jets through the B-47 Stratojet (first flight 1947) and the B-52 Stratofortress (1952). With thousands of their big jet bombers on order or in service, Boeing had developed a close relationship with the U.S. Air Force Strategic Air Command (SAC), and could count on having preference when the time came to replace SAC's fleet of piston-engined KC-97 Stratotankers. For Boeing, this was an opportunity to build a jet aircraft for air-to-air refueling that could be turned into a commercial transport.

NASA’s Orbiting Carbon Observatory satellite failed to reach orbit after its 4:55 a.m. EST liftoff Feb. 24 (2009) from California’s Vandenberg Air Force Base.

Preliminary indications are that the fairing on the Taurus XL launch vehicle failed to separate. The fairing is a clamshell structure that encapsulates the satellite as it travels through the atmosphere.

The spacecraft did not reach orbit and likely landed in the Pacific Ocean near Antarctica, said John Brunschwyler, the program manager for the Taurus XL.

A Mishap Investigation Board is to determine the cause of the launch failure.

The Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO) is a new Earth orbiting mission sponsored by NASA's Earth System Science Pathfinder Project (ESSP) Program. The ESSP Program funds competitively selected, low to moderate cost Earth Science missions. These highly focused missions acquire exploratory measurements of the atmosphere, the oceans, the land surface and the solid Earth. These missions share a common goal of improving the capability of Earth scientists to predict changes in weather, climate and natural hazards.

After launch in 2009, the OCO mission will collect precise global measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Earth's atmosphere. Scientists will analyze OCO data to improve our understanding of the natural processes and human activities that regulate the abundance and distribution of this important greenhouse gas. This improved understanding will enable more reliable forecasts of future changes in the abundance and distribution of CO2 in the atmosphere and the effect that these changes may have on the Earth's climate.

The Jet Propulsion Laboratory will lead the OCO effort. Orbital Sciences Corporation and Hamilton Sundstrand Sensor Systems will partner with JPL to realize this vital mission.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">  Spacecraft Brief Description
    The  Insat 1B was the second spacecraft in the first generation Indian
    National  Satellite  System.   The  three-axis  stabilized spacecraft,
    originally  launched  as  an on-orbit backup, replaced Insat 1A, which
    failed  in  late 1982.  It was positioned in a geosynchronous orbit at
    74  deg  E with a host of ground stations throughout India.  The Insat
    1B   satellite,   built  by  the  Ford  Aerospace  and  Communications
    Corporation,  was  designed  to  provide  combined telecommunications,
    direct  TV  broadcast,  and meteorological service to India's civilian
    community  over  a  7-year-in-orbit  lifespan.  The telecommunications
    package  provided two-way, long-distance telephone circuits and direct
    radio  and  TV  broadcasting  to  the  remotest  areas  of India.  The
    meteorology  package was comprised of a scanning very-high-resolution,
    two-channel   radiometer  (VHRR)  to  provide  full-frame,  full-earth
    coverage  every 30 min.  The visual channel (0.55-0.75 micrometer) had
    a  2.75-km resolution while the IR channel (10.5-12.5 micrometers) had
    an 11-km resolution.  Using the Insat TV capability, early warnings of
    impending  disasters  (i.e.,  floods, storms, etc.) can directly reach
    the  civilian population, even in remote areas.  The Insat 1B also had
    a   data   channel  for  relaying  meteorological,  hydrological,  and
    oceanographic  data  from  unattended  land-based  or ocean-based data
    collection and transmission platforms.
* INSAT-1B was relegated to spare status on 17 July 1990 by the
  INSAT-1D. The INSAT-1B was finally removed from GEO in August 1993,
  after being replaced at 93.50E by INSAT-2B.*

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Indian Remote Sensing Satellite-1B (IRS-1B) was launched on August 8, 1991, from Tyuratan, U.S.S.R..  IRS-1B continues the series of Earth resources remote sensing satellites developed by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) for land-based applications such as agriculture, forestry, geology, and hydrology. The spacecraft is a box-shaped 1.6 x 1.56 x 1.1 meter bus with two Sun-tracking solar arrays of 8.5 square meters each. Two nickel cadmium batteries provide power during eclipses. The three-axis stabilize sun-synchronous satellite had a 0.4 degree pitch/roll and 0.5 degree yaw pointing accuracy provided by a zero-momentum reaction wheel system utilizing Earth/Sun/star sensors and gyros. The satellite carried three Linear Imaging Self-Scanning (LISS) push-broom CCD sensors operating in four spectral bands compatible with Landsat Thematic Mapper and Spor HRV data. The bands were 0.45 - 0.52, 0.52 - 0.59, 0.62 - 0.68, and 0.77 - 0.86 microns. The LISS 1 sensor had four 2048-element CCD imagers with a focal length of 162.2 cm generating a resolution of 72.5 meters and a 148 km swath width. The LISS 2A/B sensors had eight 2048-element CCD imagers with a focal length of 324.4 mm generating a ground resolution of 36.25 meters and a 74 km swath width. The two LISS 2 imagers bracketed the LISS 1 imager providing a 3 km overlap. Data from the LISS 1 were downlinked on S-band at 5.2 Mbps and from the LISS 2 A/B at 10.4 Mbps to the ground station at Shandnager, India. The satellite was controlled from Bangalore, India.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Challenger, the second orbiter to become operational at Kennedy  Space Center, was named after the British Naval research vessel  HMS Challenger that sailed the Atlantic and Pacific oceans  during the 1870's. The Apollo 17 lunar module also carried the  name of Challenger. Like her historic predecessors, Space  Shuttle Challenger and her crews made significant contributions  to America's scientific growth.

Challenger started out as a high-fidelity structural test  article (STA-099). The airframe was completed by Rockwell and  delivered to Lockheed Plant 42 for structural testing on  02/04/78. The orbiter structure had evolved under such  weight-saving pressure that virtually all components of the air  frame were required to handle significant structural  stress. With such an optimized design, it was difficult to  accurately predict mechanical and thermal loading with the  computer software available at the time. The only safe approach  was to submit the structural test article to intensive testing  and analysis. STA-099 underwent 11 months of intensive  vibration testing in a 43 ton steel rig built especially for  the Space Shuttle Test Program. The rig consisted of 256  hydraulic jacks, distributed over 836 load application  points. Under computer control, it was possible to simulate the  expected stress levels of launch, ascent, on-orbit, reentry and  landing. Three 1 million pound-force hyd raulic cylinders were  used to simulate the thrust from the Space Shuttle Main  Engines. Heating and thermal simulations were also done.  On  January 28, 1986, the Challenger and its seven-member crew were  lost 73 seconds after launch when a booster failure resulted in  the breakup of the vehicle.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">IMS-1, previously referred to as TWSat (Third World Satellite), is a low-cost microsatellite imaging mission of ISRO (Indian Space Research Organization). The overall objective is to provide medium-resolution imagery for developing countries for free. Around 50 data reception terminals will be installed by ISRO in selected Third World countries and also at some universities in India.

he project started in 2005 with a definition phase of the mission. The ISRO approach was to develop two versions of a standard small spacecraft bus (SSB) design with the objective to provide a low-cost and a quick-response time approach to space.

• A microsatellite version (first use by the IMS-1 mission)

• A minisatellite version (first use by the SARAL mission)

The main advantage of these "smallsats" is the fact that they can be launched by a PSLV vehicle as a piggyback payload on any one of the larger primary payloads (like IRS satellites).

The modular design concept of the SSB is suited for series production making the bus a natural choice for constellation-flight applications. The design layout is such that the bus module and the payload module of each series may be integrated and tested separately (thus reducing the interdependency during the realization between both modules). Each SSB version is 3-axis stabilized. SSB is also designed to accommodate different types of payloads with minor modification from mission to mission. 

The SSB micro-bus uses aluminum honeycomb panels arranged in a cuboid structure with internal shear frames. This design is made to provide maximum area for mounting the packages while being sturdy. All the subsystem packages are mounted within the cuboid except sensors and antennas which are mounted outside. The structure includes a launch vehicle interface and solar panel interfaces. The payloads are mounted on the top deck, with optical axis towards the + yaw direction.

The power subsystem consists of solar panels, battery, power conditioning and distribution units. There are two solar panels of size 0.81m x 0.72 m in the roll direction of the satellite. The panels are stowed during the launch and deployed after injection to the orbit. The satellite is nominally in sun-pointing mode with the solar panels facing the sun. For every payload operation, the satellite is maneuvered into an Earth-pointing mode and goes back to the sun-pointing mode after the imaging operation. Multi-junction solar cells are being used to provide higher efficiency of power conversion to generate about 230 W. A Li-ion battery is used with a capacity of 10.5 Ah, having a mass of about 3.5 kg. The power subsystem provides a single raw bus of 28 to 33 V. There are four DC/DC converters which provide the required secondary voltages for the payloads and bus subsystems.

The AOCS (Attitude and Orbit Control Subsystem) uses sun sensors with 4π FOV providing an accuracy of 0.5º in all axes. The sun sensors are being used for sun acquisition and safe mode detection and recovery. A MEMS-based magnetometer is being used in the spacecraft de-tumbling support mode and in the momentum dumping of the reaction wheels. A star sensor, providing an inertial quaternion output, is used as prime sensor during 3-axis stabilization and during the maneuver support modes. The accuracy of the star sensor is &lt; 40 arcsec in all axes. In addition, there are two miniaturized gyros which are dynamically tuned. A GPS-based SPS (Satellite Positioning System) is used to provide the satellite position to an accuracy of &lt; 30 m. Actuation is provided by magnetic torquers (momentum dumping), micro reaction wheels,and an RCS (Reaction Control Subsystem). The reaction wheels have aan angular momentum capacity of 0.36 Nms and a torque of 0.015 Nm. The wheels are arranged in a tetrahedral configuration to provide enhanced torques about any axis. The RCS consists of a single tank (8 liter volume) containing a monopropellant fuel and a single 1N thruster. The thruster is primarily used for orbit corrections.

BMU (Bus Management Unit): The BMU represents the heart of the satellite providing the functions of telecommand decoding, house keeping telemetry, data encoding, sensor processing, on/off control of the subsystems and heaters, command distribution, spacecraft control during initial acquisition, normal mode, safe mode etc., using the actuators. This subsystem is realized in a single PCB (Printed Circuit Board).

Passive control methods (with elements like multi layer insulation blankets, optical surface reflectors, thermal paints and heaters wherever necessary.) are being used in the thermal control subsystem. 

Launch: A launch of IMS-1 as a secondary payload on a PSLV vehicle (PSLV-C9) took place on April 28, 2008 from the SDSC-SHAR launch site (Sriharikota, India) of ISRO. The primary payload on this flight was CartoSat-2A (launch mass of 690 kg), an Indian military high-resolution panchromatic imaging satellite (based on CartoSat-2 of ISRO).

TWSat carries two payloads: the Mx-T (Multispectral Camera) and the HySI (Hyperspectral Imager). However, since the data of both imagers is rather high, only one of them will be powered on and data transmitted at any given time.

Mx-T (Multispectral Camera). The instrument of modular design provides four spectral bands in VNIR, where each band employs an individual lens, a separate CCD detector, and separate front-end electronics. The camera operates in a pushbroom scanning mode to image the Earth. The spatial resolution at nadir is 36 m on a swath of 151 km. The 12 bit video output is coded to 10 bit with multi-linear gain. Mx-T has a mass of 5.5 kg and a power consumption of 18 W.

All the front end electronics and the video processors are accommodated on the electro optical module (EOM) itself. Each band has one detector which gives out data in 4 ports with 10 bits per pixel. The source data (32 Mbit/s) is sent to the baseband data handling system of the microsatellite bus, compressed and stored in SSR (Solid State Recorder). The recorded data is transmitted to the ground in S-band at 8 Mbit/s. 

HySI-T (Hyperspectral Imager). The prototype instrument providing a total of 64 spectral bands in the VNIR region. Spectral separation is realized using the wedge filter technique. Detection is provided with a CMOS/APS (Active Pixel Sensor) area device. - The HySI-T data may be used for resource characterization and detailed studies. The HySI-T is being used on an experimental basis to obtain experience of such a payload and also of handling the hyperspectral data and generating the application models.

Mission operations: While Mx-T serves the basic requirement of the imaging mission, the HySI-T is incorporated on an experimental basis. It is planned to operate the Mx-T instrument on for most of the orbits based on the user demands, while the HySI-T is operated over Indian ground stations for evaluation purposes. Either of the payloads will be operated at a time in order to conserve the available resources on board the microsatellite.

The data from the two payloads is being downlinked separately. The Mx-T data is compressed at a ratio of 3.4:1, formatted, RS (Reed Solomon) encoded and stored on SSR (Solid Sate Recorder). The downlink is in near real-time via the S-band transmitter. The SSR has the storage capacity of 16 Gbit providing a maximum storage volume of 20 minutes data in segmented form.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The RADARSAT-2 satellite incorporates state-of-the-art technology and features
the most advanced commercially available radar imagery in the world. The
RADARSAT-2 program ensures the continuation of the original RADARSAT program
and the development of Canada's Earth Observation business sector.

RADARSAT-2 is a unique cooperation between the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and
MacDonald Dettwiler. The CSA is providing approximately 75% of the funding for
the development of the satellite and MacDonald Dettwiler is investing the
difference. MacDonald Dettwiler will own and operate the satellite and the
CSA's investment will be recovered through the supply of imagery to a number of
government agencies during the mission lifetime.

The design of RADARSAT-2 has been driven by the needs of the emerging Earth
Observation market, to provide users around the world with high-quality data
products. RADARSAT-2 will be capable of imaging at spatial resolutions ranging
from 3 to 100 meters with swath widths ranging from 20 to 500 kilometres.
RADARSAT-2 is also the first commercial radar satellite to offer
multi-polarization capability that aids in identifying a wide variety of
surface features and targets. The satellite is scheduled for launch in 2005 and
has a design life of 7 years.

RADARSAT-2 is a truly world-class mission and the next step in MacDonald
Dettwiler's goal to being a world-leading company in the delivery of a broad
range of information products and services to manage the scope of human
activities on our planet.

DMSP (72-089A), also known as DMSP 6530, was one of a series of meteorological satellites developed and operated by the Air Force under the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program. The program, previously known as Data Acquisition and Processing Program (DAPP), was classified until March 1973. The objective of this program was to provide global visual and infrared (IR) cloudcover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense requirements. Operationally, the program consisted of two satellites in 830 km sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite near the sunrise terminator and the other near local noon. The satellite, shaped like the frustum of a polyhedron, consisted of four subassemblies -- (1) a solar array hat, (2) a base-plate assembly, (3) a sensor AVE (Aerospace Vehicle Electronics) package (SAP), and (4) a data processing system. The primary sensor (SAP) was a four channel scanning radiometer. Secondary sensors included a vertical temperature profile radiometer (supplementary sensor E -SSE) and an electron spectrograph (supplementary sensor J/2 - SSJ/2), which were mounted, along with the primary sensor, on the base-plate assembly. Spacecraft stabilization was controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system so that the sensors were maintained in the desired earth-looking mode. The data processing system included three tape recorders capable of storing a total of 440 min of data, which allowed full global coverage twice daily. Either recorded or real-time data were transmitted to ground receiving sites via an s-band transmitter. Recorded data were read out to tracking sites located at Fairchild AFB, Wa, and Loring AFB, ME, and relayed to Air Force Global Weather Central, Offutt AFB, NE. Real-time data were read out a mobile tactical sites located around the world.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Orbiting Geophysical Observatory (OGO 1) was successfully launched from
Cape Kennedy on 5 September 1964 and placed into an initial orbit of 281 x
149,385 km at 31 degrees inclination. Two experiment booms failed to properly
deploy, with one of the booms obscuring a horizon scanner's view of earth. As a
result, the spacecraft attitude could not be earth oriented and OGO 1 remained
spin stabilized at 5 rpm. Nevertheless, data from all 20 experiments on board
was received, although at a "less than expected capacity" from some of them.
During September 1964, acceptable data were received over 70% of the orbital
path. Spacecraft operation was restricted to Spring and Fall due to power
supply limitations. There were 11 such 3-month periods prior to the spacecraft
being put into stand-by mode on 25 November 1969. OGO 1 was completely
terminated on 1 November 1971.

On board was the Positron Search and Gamma-Ray Spectrum experiment of Cline et
al. It was designed to determine whether low-energy (0-3 MeV) positrons are
trapped temporarily or permanently in the Van Allen regions and whether
low-energy solar and interplanetary positrons exist at the edge of the Earth's
magnetic field. A secondary objective was to detect gamma-ray bursts from the
Sun in the energy range 80 keV - 1 MeV. The experiment consisted of 3 CsI
crystals surrounded by a plastic anti-coincidence shield. The output of the
whole unit was monitored by 3 PMTs. Once every 18.5 seconds, integral intensity
measurements were made in each of 16 energy channels which were equally spaced
over the .08-1 MeV range.

The experiment did not achieve its goals due to electrical interference and
secular degradation of the PMT responses. However, searching back through the
data after the discovery of cosmic gamma-ray bursts by the Vela satellites
revealed the detection of one or more such events in the OGO 1 data.

FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC Overview

FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC (F3C) is a joint Taiwan/US science mission for weather, climate, space weather and geodetic research. The F3C mission was successfully launched on 15 April 2006. Six identical micro satellites, each carrying an advanced GPS radio occultation (RO) receiver, a Tiny Ionospheric Photometer (TIP) and a Tri Band Beacon (TBB) were deployed. The satellites have since been raised by Taiwan's National Space Organization (NSPO) to their final orbit altitude at 800km to achieve an operational constellation of six orbital planes separated by 30 degrees. The payload science data are currently being downloaded every orbit via two NOAA TT&amp;C stations (in Alaska and Norway) and one NSF/NASA station in McMurdo, Antarctica and transferred to the COSMIC Data Analysis and Archival Center (CDAAC) at UCAR in Boulder. The CDAAC currently processes the COSMIC science data in near real time - Ninety percent of RO profiles are delivered to operational weather centers within 3 hours of observation. CDAAC also reprocesses data in a more accurate post-processed mode (within 6 weeks of observation) for COSMIC as well as other missions including GPS/MET, CHAMP, SAC-C, and GRACE.

COSMIC is currently providing between 1000-2500 daily RO profiles in the neutral atmosphere, 1000-2500 daily electron density profiles and total electron content arcs, and TIP radiance products. The data have already demonstrated their value for operational weather forecasting, hurricane forecasting, and investigations of the atmospheric boundary layer. The data have been used extensively to test ionospheric models and their use in operational space weather models is under development. COSMIC GPS RO data also have the potential to be of great benefit to climate studies due to their demonstrated high precision and global and diurnal sampling coverage.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">There are two types of remote sensing instrument on board
RESURS-O1. The MSU-E is comparable with instruments on other
satellites, such as Landsat, while the MSU-SK offers
perspectives of the Earth that have never been available
before. It has a wide swath and medium resolution, and bridges
the enormous gap in coverage and detail between SPOT/Landsat TM
and NOAA AVHRR. It makes it an ideal complement to both of these
data sets, better defining the regional context of a local
study, or giving focus at regional scales to a continental
survey.

The BPR resides on the ocean bottom and monitors water pressure with a resolution of approximately 1 mm seawater. Samples integrated over a 15-second time window are recorded internally by the BPR and provide the base sampling interval for all real-time transmissions. Data are transmitted from the BPR to the surface buoy via an acoustic modem which in turn transmits the data to ground systems via Iridium satellites.

The CALIPSO satellite was developed to help scientists answer significant questions and provide new information about the effects of clouds and aerosols (airborne particles) on changes in the Earth's climate. Understanding these components will provide the international science community with a more comprehensive data set that is essential for a better understanding of the Earth's climatic processes. Accurate climate model predictions will provide international and national leaders accurate information to make more informed policy decisions about global climate change.

CALIPSO flies a 3-channel lidar with a suite of passive instruments in formation with Aqua to obtain coincident observations of radiative fluxes and atmospheric conditions. This enables new observationally based assessments of the radiative effects of aerosol and clouds that will greatly improve out ability to predict future climate change.

CloudSat also flies in formation with CALIPSO to provide a comprehensive characterization of the structure and composition of clouds and their effects on climate under all weather conditions. This comprehensive set of measurements is essential for accurate quantification of global aerosol and cloud radiative effects to understand their role in formation and variation of Earth's climate. This is a cooperative mission with France.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Fast Auroral SnapshoT Explorer (FAST), the second mission in NASA's Small
Explorer Satellite Program (SMEX), is a satellite designed to study Earth's
aurora. This highly successful spacecraft has helped scientists answer
fundamental questions about the causes and makeup of the aurora. 

FAST was launched on August 21, 1996 from a Pegasus rocket into a highly
elliptical orbit. It crosses Earth's auroral zones (donut shaped regions
centered on the poles) four times each orbit, and only collects high-resolution
data ("snapshots") while in those zones. It ventures high into the charged
particle environment of the aurora to measure the electric and magnetic fields,
plasma waves, energetic electrons and ions, ion mass composition, and thermal
plasma density and temperature.

The FAST instrument set consists of sixteen electrostatic analyzers, four
electric field langmuir probes suspended on 30 m wire booms, two electric field
langmuir probes on 3 m extendible booms, searchcoil and fluxgate magnetometers
and a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. The science investigation makes
extremely temporal and spatial resolution measurements of the auroral plasma at
apogee altitude. The instrument hardware consists of the sensor assemblies and
an instrument data processor. The instrument electronics include a 32-bit data
processing unit that performs the science data processing and recording in a
one gigabit, solid-state memory. The stored data are transferred to the ground
at one of three selectable high data rates of 900 Kbps, 1.5 Mbps or 2.25 Mbps.
The instruments weigh 51 kg; the total observatory mass is 191 kg. The FAST
mission is in a 351 x 4175 km orbit with an 83? inclination.

The FAST observatory is a 12 rpm, spin-stabilized spacecraft with its spin axis
oriented parallel to the orbit axis. Spin rate and spin-axis orientation are
maintained by two magnetic torquer coils, one spinning Sun sensor, one horizon
crossing indicator and a spacecraft magnetometer. The Attitude Control System
(ACS) provides closed-loop spin-rate control. Spin-axis precession is performed
open loop and is closed via ground commands. After computation on the ground,
attitude knowledge is accurate to within one degree.

The body-mounted solar array contains 5.6 m2 of solar cells that can distribute
52 W of orbit average power to the spacecraft and instruments. The orbit
average power consumption of the spacecraft hardware is 33 W. The instruments
consume 19 W orbit average power, 39 W when operating. Instruments are
frequently powered off in order to maintain a positive energy balance.

The data system for the FAST mission consists of dual 8085, 8-bit spacecraft
computers. The spacecraft computers perform health and safety functions, power
distribution, data encoding/decoding and launch vehicle interface. A
multi-element micropatch antenna mounted on a boom above the spacecraft
supports ground communications. Commands are uplinked at 2 Kbps. Health and
safety data is telemetered to the ground at 4 Kbps. A Transportable Orbital
Tracking Station (TOTS) was placed in Alaska to collect real-time science
telemetry while the spacecraft is passing through the northern aurora. TOTS is
highly automated and portable; it has an 8 m antenna with 200 W of uplink power
and can be packed for shipment in three ISO containers.
 
The FAST instruments consist of:
Electric Field Experiment: The electric field experiment is composed of three
orthogonal boom pairs. Spherical sensors deployed on radial wire and axial
stacer booms will provide information on the plasma density and electron
temperature.

Magnetic Field Experiment: The magnetic field experiment consists of two
magnetometers mounted 180? apart on deployable graphite epoxy booms. The search
coil magnetometer uses a three-axis sensor system to provide magnetic field
data over the frequency range of 10 Hz to 2.5 kHz. The flux gate magnetometer
is a three-axis system using high, stable, low noise, ring core sensors to
provide magnetic field information for DC to 100 Hz.

Time-of-Flight Energy Angle Mass Spectrograph (TEAMS): The TEAMS instrument is
a high sensitivity, mass-resolving spectrometer that measures full
three-dimension distribution functions of the major ion species with one spin
of the spacecraft. The TEAMS experiment covers the core of all plasma
distributions of importance in the auroral region.

Electrostatic Analyzers (ESA): Sixteen ESAs configured in four stacks will be
used for both electron and ion measurements. The four stacks are placed around
the spacecraft such that the entire package is provided a full 360? field of
view. The ESAs can provide a 64-step energy sweep, covering approximately 3 eV
to 30 KeV up to 16 times per second.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Japan Marine Science and Technology Center (JAMSTEC) is developing a surface moored buoy network named TRITON (TRIangle Trans-Ocean Buoy Network) for observing oceanic and atmospheric variability in the Pacific Ocean and its adjacent seas in cooperation interested Japanese and foreign agencies and institutions. The principal scientific objective is to understand variations of ocean circulation and heat/salt transports with emphasis on ENSO, the Asian monsoon, and decadal scale variability that influences world wide climate change. In its first phase, the TRITON array will be established mainly in the western tropical pacific Ocean, and harmonized with TAO array which are presently maintained by Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL), NOAA. The fundamental functions of TRITON are (1) basin scale ENSO monitoring, and (2) measurements of heat, freshwater, momentum fluxes for improving modeling capability.

The TRITON (Triangle Trans-Ocean buoy network) is a series of buoys for measuring surface meteorology and upper ocean.

The buoys will be deployed by JAMSTEC in collaboration with many countries in and around the Pacific Ocean as part of international climate research programs.

The buoys measure wind, air temperature, humidity, precipitation, short wave radiation, water temperature, salinity and current. The water temperature and will be measured down to 750m depth.

The data will be transmitted via satellite near real time and provided to researchers in the world.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Cessna 310/320

The sleek Cessna 310 was the first twin engine design from Cessna to enter production after WW2.

The 310 first flew on January 3 1953. The modern rakish lines of the new twin were backed up by innovative features such as engine exhaust thrust augmentor tubes and the storage of all fuel in tip tanks. Deliveries commenced in late 1954.

The first significant upgrade to the 310 line came with the 310C of 1959, which introduced more powerful 195kW (260hp) IO-470-D engines. The 310D of 1960 featured swept back vertical tail surfaces. An extra cabin window was added with the 310F. A development of the 310F was the turbocharged 320 Skyknight, with TSIO-470-B engines and a fourth cabin side-window. The Skyknight was in production between 1961 and 1969 (the 320D, E and F were named Executive Skyknight), when it was replaced by the similar Turbo 310.

The 310G introduced the 'stabila-tip' tip tanks, while the 310K replaced the rear two windows on each side with a single unit. Subsequent significant developments include the 310Q and turbocharged T310Q with redesigned rear cabin with a skylight window, and the final 310R and T310R, identifiable for their lengthened noses. Production ended in 1980.

USAF military versions were the L-27A (310A) and L-27B (310M) Blue Canoe, later redesignated U-3A and U-3B.

Cosmos-1500 was a precursor to the operational Russian Okean ("Ocean") series of oceanographic remote sensing missions. Cosmos-1500 was launched into a 649 x 679 km orbit at 82.6 deg. inclination. The Cosmos-1500 tested new sensors and methods of data collection and processing. Cosmos-1500 had the capability of overlapping and processing images from its sensors. Data from Cosmos-1500 were sent directly to ships or automated data receiving stations and was applied in navigation in northern oceans. The instrument complement was highlighted by an all-weather X-band Side-Looking Real Aperature radar (SLRAR) operating at 9.5 GHz. other instruments included a multispectral scanner (MSL), a scanning high-frequency radiometer (SHF), and transponders for collecting data from ice and buoy transmitters.

Spacecraft Brief Description
  This  RAE-B  mission  was  the  second  of  a  pair of Radio Astronomy
  Explorer satellites.  It was placed into lunar orbit on June 15, 1973,
  to  provide  radio  astronomical measurements of the planets, the sun,
  and  the  galaxy  over the frequency range of 25 kHz to 13.1 MHz.  The
  experiment  complement consisted of two Ryle-Vonberg radiometers (nine
  channels  each),  three  swept-frequency  burst receivers (32 channels
  each),  and  an  impedance  probe  for  calibration.   The  experiment
  antennas  consisted  of  a 229-m upper V-antenna pointed away from the
  moon;  a  183-m  lower  V-antenna  pointed toward the moon; and a 37-m
  dipole antenna parallel to the lunar surface.  The lower V-antenna was
  extended  to  its  full 229-m length in November 1974.  The spacecraft
  body  was a truncated cylinder 36.25 in. in diameter and approximately
  31-in.  high,  with  four fixed solar paddles.  The maneuvering system
  consisted  of  a  hydrazine  velocity  correction  package, a cold gas
  attitude control system, and a solid fuel lunar insertion motor.  Data
  were  returned  to  the  earth  via  either  a low power UHF/(400 MHz)
  transmitter,  in  real time, or stored in an onboard tape recorder and
  transmitted  to  earth via a high power UHF transmitter (400 MHz). Two
  tape  recorders  provided  backup  storage.   A VHF transmitter served
  primarily  for  range  and  range-rate  measurements  and as a backup.
  Commands  were  received on a VHF (148 MHz) receiver, which also was a
  part  of  the  range  and  range-rate  system. Spacecraft attitude was
  determined  by (1) a solar aspect system, (2) a horizon sensor system,
  and (3) a panoramic attitude sensor system, and was accurate to 1 deg.
  The spacecraft was gravity gradient oriented (Z axis parallel to local
  vertical)  and  was  equipped  with  libration  dampers  to  damp  out
  oscillations.  For additional information, see J. K. Alexander et al.,
  Astron. &amp; Astrophys., v. 40, p. 365, 1975.

JERS-1 is an Earth Observation Satellite to cover the global land area for national land survey, agriculture, forestry, and fishery, environmental protection, disaster protection, and coastal monitoring, etc. focusing on observation around the world and resource exploitation. It was launched into a solar-synchronous sub-recurrent orbit at an altitude of 568 km with a recurrent period of 44 days by the H-I launch vehicle on February 11, 1992 from National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) Tanegashima Space Center, and has been continuing to observe and collect data with a mission data recorder by the high performance Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Optical Sensor (OPS).

SAR is an active sensor which transmits microwave and observes characteristics, inequality, slope in the surface of the earth, etc. without being influenced by the weather day and night due to scattered waves from the Earth.

OPS can observe in seven bands from the visible region to short wave infrared band and is capable of stereoscopic observation by forward look of 15.3 (J from nadir in near infrared band and highly is usable for identifying stones, rocks, and minerals.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Alouette-1 was a small ionospheric space based observatory instrumented
with an ionospheric sounder (radio transmitter), a VLF radio wave receiver,
an energetic particle detector, and a cosmic radio noise experiment.

EXTERIOR EQUIPMENT:  Extended from the satellite skin (shell) were two
dipole antennas (45.7-meter and 22.8-meter long, respectively) which were
shared by three of the experiments on this spacecraft.

SPACECRAFT ROTATION (SPIN):  The satellite was spin-stabilized at
about 1.4 rpm after antenna extension.  After about 500 days in orbit,
the ALOUETTE-1 spin rate slowed more than had been expected, to about
0.6 rpm when satellite spin-stabilization failed.  It is now believed
that the satellite gradually progressed towards a gravity gradient
stabilization with the longer antenna pointing earthward.  Attitude
information was deduced from a single onboard magnetometer only, and
aided by temperature measurements on the upper and lower heat shields.

DATA ACQUISITION:  Alouette-1 was an early space era satellite, and
there was no onboard tape recorder so data were available to the
ground stations only from the immediate vicinity of the telemetry
stations.  The ground telemetry stations were located to provide
primary data coverage near the 80 degrees West meridian and in
areas near Hawaii, Singapore, Australia, Europe and Central Africa.
Initially, data were recorded for about 6 hours per day.  In September
1972, spacecraft operations were terminated.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The TIPS satellite was deployed on 20 June 1996 at an altitude
of 1,022 kilometers (552 nautical miles). This experiment is
designed to increase knowledge about gravity-gradient tether
dynamics and the survivability of tethers in space. (Tethers can
be severed by space debris.) The National Reconnaissance Office
(NRO) is a sponsor of the TiPS program. While tethers have been
theoretically studied as a means for satellite stabilization,
propulsion, and electricity generation for some time, TiPS is
among the first successful tether deployments in space and is
the first experiment designed for long duration.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The PA-31 Navajo is a family of cabin-class, twin-engine aircraft designed and built by Piper Aircraft using Lycoming engines for the general aviation market.

In the mid-1960s, an aircraft of this size was sorely needed and founder William T. Piper requested the type be developed. Targeted at small-scale cargo and feeder liner operations and the corporate market, the aircraft was a success. It continues to prove a popular choice, but due to greatly decreased demand across the general aviation sector in the 1980s, production of the PA-31 ceased.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Gemini  12  was the tenth and final flight of the Gemini series, which bridged the Mercury and Apollo programs. This mission was scheduled to perform  rendezvous  and  docking  with  the  Agena target vehicle, to conduct three extravehicular activity (EVA) operations, and to conduct a  tethered  station keeping  exercise.  There were also 14 scientific, medical,  and  technological  experiments  on  board. The successfully performed  scientific  experiments  were  (1)  frog  egg  growth under zero-g,   (2)  synoptic  terrain  photography,  (3)  synoptic  weather photography,  (4)  nuclear emulsions, (5) airglow horizon photography, (6)  UV  astronomical  photography,  and  (7) dim sky photography. Two micrometeorite   collection   experiments,  as  well  as  three  space phenomena  photography  experiments,  were  not fully completed. There were  fuel  cell  and  attitude  control  thruster problems during the mission,   which   was   otherwise   highly  successful.  Reentry  was accomplished  after  59  orbits,  with  the spacecraft under automatic control.  It  landed  within  4.8  km  of the intended impact point on november 15, 1966.

The two primary goals of this satellite were to minimize the effects of
non-gravitational forces and to obtain the highest possible accuracy for laser
range measurements. The satellite was spherically shaped with a 12-cm radius.
The core was an alloy of uranium 238 and 1.5% molybdenum. The skin consisted of
20 spherical caps made of an alloy of aluminum and 5% magnesium with triangular
bases. Each cap contained three laser corner cubes. The corner cubes were fused
silica trihedrons with circular apertures made of suprasil 1 with silver
coatings covered by inconel. For Groupe de Recherches de Geodesie Spatiale
(GRGS), the principal objective was to study earth and ocean tides by (1) the
determination of the second harmonics (amplitude and phase) of the main
semidiurnal oceanic tides (M and S) and, if possible, of the diurnal K, O, and
P tides; and (2) the determination of the dissipation in the solid earth and in
the oceans (Q).

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">TopSat is a micro-satellite designed and built by a QinetiQ-led consortium of British firms. Images from the satellite are provided free of charge to relief agencies responding to disasters anywhere in world.

TopSat was designed and built by a consortium of British companies led by QinetiQ, whose role included systems design and technical authority, provision of payload electronics units, project and operations management and data reception. Other consortium members are Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL), Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL) designed and Infoterra.

The satellite is designed to return its data directly to a mobile ground station immediately after collecting an image, allowing far more timely delivery of the information which it collects than standard satellites. The system is specifically designed to meet operational timescales, whether for disaster relief, news-gathering, or other applications where speed of response is vital.

TopSat received the Aviation and Space Grand Award – the top award for aerospace technology, from Popular Science, the best selling science and technology magazine in the world. The magazine’s editors concluded that TopSat is an innovation that has the potential to change satellite and space reconnaissance technology.

TopSat weighs just 120 kg, but carries an optical camera capable of delivering panchromatic images with a spatial resolution at nadir of 2.8 metres covering a 17x17 km area, and simultaneous three-band multi-spectral images, (red, green, blue), with a resolution of 5.6 metres. This is thought to represent the best resolution per mass of any satellite launched to date. This camera is integrated with an agile micro-satellite platform to permit pitch compensation manoeuvres, allowing imaging of low illumination scenes.

TopSat has been in operation since its launch from Plesetsk in Russia on 27th October 2005. The satellite can be reprogrammed in orbit, and the consortium is exploiting this to enhance its performance. In addition to actively pursuing experiments for the MOD and BNSC, the consortium is also seeking new applications to which the technology can be applied. In the future, a constellation of three or four TopSat satellites could image almost any point on the Earth at least once a day, further opening up the potential for quick response imagery which is extremely cost effective to deliver.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">MicroLab 1, also known as OrbView 1 was launched on April 3,
1995, OrbView-1 provides the world's first broad-area
cloud-to-cloud lightning data.

OrbView-1's payload consists of two sensors:

-an Optical Transient Detector (OTD) provided by NASA's Marshall
Space Flight Center, and

-an atmospheric monitoring instrument (GPS/MET) sponsored by the
National Science Foundation and the University Consortium for
Atmospheric Research.

The OTD sensor maps atmospheric lighting strikes and has
provided NASA with information important to the understanding of
severe weather patterns. The GPS/MET sensor has proven that the
signals from the GPS satellite constellation used for precision
navigation can also be used to provide important atmospheric
data. The success of the GPS/MET sensor has further validated
the concept of using space-based sensors to improve worldwide
weather prediction.

The OrbView-1 program is the result of a unique
government-industry partnership between ORBIMAGE and NASA. Under
this arrangement, NASA provided the OTD sensor for use on
OrbView-1 and ORBIMAGE agreed to conduct an initial six-month
experiment of the sensor. NASA's cost for data under this
program over the past five years has totaled approximately
&amp;#367.2 million.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Russian Meteor-2 series of spacecraft are polar-orbiting weather
satellites designed to provide continuous daily coverage of the Earth's
surface and weather patterns. The Meteor-2 provides global data on the
distribution of clouds, snow and ice, radiation fluxes, atmospheric
temperature, humidity sounding data, cloud-top heights and sea-surface
temperature. The series has been of particular importance in providing
information to Russian ships on weather systems and sea-ice conditions.
Typically, two Meteor satellites are in orbit at the same time to
cover almost 80% of the Earth's surface in 6 hours. The Meteor-2
instrumentation consists of (1) three television-type visible and
infrared scanners, (2) an 8-channel scanning radiometer, and (3) a
radiation-flux device for measuring radiation flux densities in
near-space. The two visible scanners operate in the 0.5-0.7 micrometer
region and has a swath width of 2100 and 2400 km at a resolution of 2
and 1 km, respectively. These scanners provide images and mosaics of
arctic and antarctic oceans. The IR scanner operates in the 8-12
micrometer range with a swath width of 2600 km at a resolution of 8
km. The IR scanner provides imagery of clouds and surface. The
8-channel infrared radiometer operates in the 11.1 to 18.7 micrometer
range with a swath of 1000 km at 30 km resolution. This instrument
provides atmospheric sounding data and total ozone content.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">he next-generation commercial imaging satellite of DigitalGlobe Inc. (Longmont, CO, USA) is called WorldView-1, a successor of QuickBird-2 (launch Oct. 18, 2001 - and fully operational as of 2007). In Oct. 2003, DigitalGlobe was awarded a sizeable contract by NGA (National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency) of Washington DC, formerly NIMA (National Imaging and Mapping Agency), to provide high-resolution imagery from the next-generation commercial imaging satellites.

The NGA requirements call for imagery with a spatial resolution of 0.5 m panchromatic and 2 m MS (Multispectral) data. The contract award was made within NGA's NextView program, designed to give the US commercial imaging satellite operators the financing to build their satellites for high-resolution imaging. The WorldView mission is intended to provide imaging services to NGA as well as to the commercial customer base of DigitalGlobe.

Spacecraft:

BATC (Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corporation) of Boulder, CO, is the prime contractor and integrator of the spacecraft, providing the S/C bus (Ball Commercial Platform BCP-5000) and a WorldView-60 camera. A new feature of the WorldView spacecraft are CMG (Control Moment Gyroscopes) actuators for precise and highly responsive pointing control. The BCP-5000 bus provides increased power, stability, agility, data storage and transmission (over the BCP-2000 bus) as the demand for Earth remote-sensing information becomes more comprehensive. 

The S/C is 3-axis stabilized. The ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem) employs star trackers, IRU (Inertial Reference Unit) and GPS for attitude sensing, and CMGs as actuators. A S/C body-pointing range of ±40º about nadir is provided corresponding to a FOR (Field of Regard) of 775 km in cross-track. An instantaneous pointing accuracy of ≤ 500 m is provided at any start and stop of an imaging sequence. On the ground, the geolocation accuracy of the imagery is 5.8 to 7.6 m without GPCs (Ground Control Points) and 2 m with GPCs (3σ). The agile S/C provides retargeting at a rate of 4.5º/s with an acceleration of 2.5º/s2; it takes 9 s to slew the S/C over a ground distance of 300 km.

S/C power of 3.2 kW (EOL) is provided by the solar panels; the battery capacity is 100 Ah. The solar arrays are being articulated into the sun (normal pointing into the sun). The rotational drive assemblies and drive control electronics, referred to as QuAD (Quiet Array Drive), are being provided by Starsys, a subsidiary of SpaceDev, Poway, CA. Unlike traditional stepper motor solar array drives, the QuAD technology provides low disturbance actuation, allowing spacecraft images to be captured at the same time that the solar arrays are being pointed.

The S/C bus has dimensions of 3.6 m (high) and 2.5 m in diameter, the span of the deployed panels measures 7.1 m. WorldView-1 has a launch mass of 2500 kg. The mission design life is 7.25 years. 

Launch: A launch of the WorldView-1 spacecraft took place on Sept. 18, 2007 on a Delta-2920 vehicle from VAFB, CA.

Orbit: Sun-synchronous circular orbit, altitude = 496 km (nominal), inclination = 97.2º. The equator crossing time is at 10:30 hours on a descending node. The period is 94.6 minutes. Note: While the low-altitude orbit selection offers better spatial resolutions than a higher one, it requires also more frequent reboosts to maintain the low orbit due to atmospheric drag influences.

RF communications: The command data are in S-band at 2 or 64 kbit/s. The housekeeping telemetry and tracking is in X-band at 4, 16, or 32 kbit/s of real-time data, or 524 kbit/s of stored data. The imagery is downlinked in X-band at 800 Mbit/s. The S/C provides a data storage capacity of 2.2 Tbit in solid state memory with EDAC (Error Detection and Correction). A total of 331 Gbit of imagery per orbit may be collected.  In addition, direct (real-time) downlinks to customer sites are available using the same high-speed 800 Mbit/s X-band link. 

Mission status: In early January 2008, DigitalGlobe announced the general availability of WorldView-1 imagery to its customers after all check-out aspects of the spacecraft and its payload had been completed. 6)

• DigitalGlobe delivered its first sample set of high-resolution images on Oct. 15, 2007 and began supplying imagery to the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) on Nov. 26, 2007 (the S/C reached already full operating capacity on Nov. 17. 2007).

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Cessna 188 is a family of light agricultural airplanes produced between 1966 and 1983 by the Cessna Aircraft Company.

The various versions of the 188 — the AGwagon, AGpickup, AGtruck and AGhusky, along with the AGcarryall variant of the 185, constituted Cessna's line of agricultural aircraft.

In the early 1960s Cessna decided to expand their already wide line of light aircraft by entering the agricultural aircraft market. They surveyed pilots and operators of other brands of agricultural aircraft to see what features and capabilities these operators were looking for. The resulting aircraft was a conventional single-seat, piston-powered, strut-braced low-winged agricultural airplane.

The 188 is the only single-engined Cessna design that does not have a high-wing.

The Cessna 188 borrowed heavily from the Cessna 180, the initial version using the same tail cone and fin structure as well as the same Continental O-470-R 230hp (170kW) powerplant. The 188’s airframe is predominantly built from 2024-T3 aluminum, with the chemical hopper constructed from fibreglass. The fuselage is of semi-monocoque construction and is pressurized on later models (using the dynamic pressure resulting from the aircraft's forward speed) to reduce induction of chemicals into the airframe.

The Cessna 188 was first flown on 19 February 1965. The aircraft was certified and entered production in February 1966, with 241 aircraft delivered the first year.

The initial design of the Cessna 188 was so successful that over its 17-year production run the basic airframe remained unchanged. Only the engines and the agricultural products dispensing systems were upgraded, other than some minor changes to the ventilation systems.

A total of 3967 Cessna 188s of all four variants were built during its production run.

[SDO was successfully launched on 2010-02-11.  Please follow the SDO home page for mission updates. http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/  ] 

The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is the first mission to be launched for NASA's Living With a Star (LWS) Program, a program designed to understand the causes of solar variability and its impacts on Earth. SDO is designed to help us understand study the Sun's influence on Earth and Near-Earth space by studying observing the solar atmosphere on small scales of space and time and in many wavelengths simultaneously.

SDO's goal is to understand, driving towards a predictive capability, the solar variations that influence life on Earth and humanity's technological systems by determining how the Sun's magnetic field is generated and structured how this stored magnetic energy is converted and released into the heliosphere and geospace in the form of solar wind, energetic particles, and variations in the solar irradiance. SDO data will help us to understand the cause the how and why of the Sun's magnetic activity changes. It will determine how the magnetic field is generated and structured, and how the stored magnetic energy is released into the heliosphere and geospace. SDO data and analysis will also help us develop the ability to predict the solar activity variations. that influence life on Earth and humanity's technological systems.

SDO will observe different layers in solar atmosphere from visible surface, photosphere, to outer corona. measure the properties of the Sun and solar activity. There are few types of measurements but many of them will be taken. For example, Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) will record maps of magnetic fields on entire visible solar hemisphere. HMI will also observe flows of plasma in the photosphere. These observations will be used to study motions throughout solar atmosphere: from the global scale (solar rotation), to small spatial scales (e.g. convective motions, which the surface velocity is measured by HMI. This data can be used for many different studies. One is the surface rotation rate, which must be removed to study the others. After subtracting the rotation, you have the oscillation and convective velocities. The latter look like billows of storm clouds covering the Sun. Hot gas moves outward at the center of the billows and downward at the edges—just like boiling water). Data from HMI will also allow us to study processes taking place underneath the visible surface. These studies will be conducted using methods of helioseismology, in the same manner as geologies on Earth study interior of our planet. Other SDO instruments,  Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) will study hot outer layers of solar atmosphere, corona. AIA will take images and movies of corona in several wavelengths of ultraviolet light. The third SDO instrument, ), Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (EVE)  will observe total every flux from the Sun, or irradiance. The variations in irradiance are important component of Earth's atmosphere and climate models.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Nimbus-3 was launched in April 1969 and was the third in a series of
second-generation meteorological research-and-development satellites that was
designed to serve as a stabilized, earth-oriented platform for the testing of
advanced meteorological sensor systems and for collecting meteorological data.
The polar-orbiting spacecraft consisted of three major elements: (1) a sensory
ring, (2) solar paddles, and (3) the control system housing. The solar paddles
and the control system housing were connected to the sensory ring by a truss
structure, giving the satellite the appearance of an ocean buoy. Nimbus-3 was
nearly 3.7 m tall, 1.5 m in diameter at the base, and about 3 m across with
solar paddles extended. The torus-shaped sensory ring, which formed the
satellite base, housed the electronics equipment and battery modules. The lower
surface of the torus ring provided mounting space for sensors and telemetry
antennas. An H-frame structure mounted within the center of the torus provided
support for the larger experiments and tape recorders. Mounted on the control
system housing, which was located on top of the spacecraft, were sun sensors,
horizon scanners, gas nozzles for attitude control, and a command antenna. Use
of the attitude control subsystem (ACS) permitted the spacecraft's orientation
to be controlled to within plus or minus 1 degree for all three axes (pitch,
roll, and yaw).
Primary experiments consisted of a satellite infrared spectrometer (SIRS) for
determining the vertical temperature profiles of the atmosphere, an infrared
interferometer spectrometer (IRIS) for measuring the emission spectra of the
earth-atmosphere system, both high- and medium-resolution infrared radiometers
(HRIR and MRIR) for yielding information on the distribution and intensity of
infrared radiation emitted and reflected by the earth and its atmosphere,
monitor of ultraviolet solar energy (MUSE) for detecting solar UV radiation,
image dissector camera system for providing daytime cloudcover pictures in both
real-time mode using the real time transmission system and tape recorder mode
using the high data rate storage system, radioisotope thermoelectric generator
(RTG) SNAP-19 to assess the operational capability of radioisotope power for
space applications, and an interrogation, recording and location system (IRLS)
experiment designed to locate, interrogate, record, and retransmit
meteorological and geophysical data from remote collection stations.
Nimbus-3 was successful and performed normally until July 22, 1969, when the
IRIS experiment failed. The HRIR and the SIRS experiments were terminated on
January 25, 1970, and June 21, 1970, respectively. The remaining experiments
continued operation until September 25, 1970, when the rear horizon scanner
failed. Without this horizon scanner, it was impossible to maintain proper
spacecraft attitude, thus making most experimental observations useless. All
spacecraft operations were terminated on January 22, 1972.

GOES 5 was launched in May 1981 and was a NASA-developed, NOAA-operated, geosynchronous, and operational spacecraft.  The cylindrically shaped spacecraft measured 190.5 cm in diameter and 230 cm in length, exclusive of a magnetometer that extended an additional 83 cm beyond the cylinder shell. The primary structural members were a honeycombed equipment shelf and thrust tube. The VISSR telescope was mounted on the equipment shelf and viewed the Earth through a special aperture in the side of the spacecraft.  A support structure extended radially out from the thrust tube and was affixed to the solar panels, which formed the outer walls of the spacecraft and provided the primary source of electrical power.  Located in the annulus-shaped space between the thrust tube and the solar panels were stationkeeping and dynamics control equipment, batteries, and most of the SEM equipment.  Proper spacecraft attitude and spin rate (approximately 100 rpm) were maintained by two separate sets of jet thrusters mounted around the spacecraft equator and activated by ground command.  The spacecraft used both UHF-band and S-band frequencies in its telemetry and command subsystem.  A low-power VHF transponder provided telemetry and command during launch and then served as a backup for the primary subsystem once the spacecraft attained orbit.

The spin-stabilized spacecraft carried a visible infrared spin-scan radiometer atmospheric sounder, meteorological data collection and transmission system, space environment monitor, and a biaxial fluxgate magnetometer.  It operated at at 75 degrees West as GOES-EAST, but on July 30, 1984, GOES 5 VAS experienced a failure, thus NOAA had to relocate GOES 6 to a more central 98 degrees West position, and to reactivate GOES 1 and GOES 4 for the acquisition and relay of VISSR information, respectively, from the western U.S.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Global Position System (GPS), counterpart to the Russian Global Navigation
System (GLONASS), is a United States Department of Defense (DoD) developed,
worldwide, satellite-based radionavigation system that will be the DoD's
primary radionavigation system well into the next century. The constellation
consists of 24 operational satellites. The U.S. Air Force Space Command (AFSC)
formally declared the GPS satellite constellation as having met the requirement
for Full Operational Capability (FOC) as of April 27, 1995. Requirements
include 24 operational satellites functioning in their assigned orbits and
successful testing completed for operational military functionality.

GPS consists of three segments, the SPACE, CONTROL and USER Segment:

1. The SPACE segment consists of 24 operational satellites in six orbital
planes, (four satellites in each plane). The satellites operate in circular
20,200 km orbits at an inclination angle of 55 degrees and with a 12-hour
period. The position is therefore the same at the same sidereal time each day,
i.e. the satellites appear four minutes earlier each day.

2. The CONTROL segment consists of five Monitor Stations, three Ground
Antennas, and a Master Control Station (MCS) located at Falcon AFB in Colorado.
The monitor stations passively track all satellites in view, accumulating
ranging data. This information is processed at the MCS to determine satellite
orbits and to update each satellite's navigation message. Updated information
is transmitted to each satellite via the Ground Antennas.

3. The USER segment consists of antennas and receiver-processors that
provide positioning, velocity and precise timing to the user.

GPS provides two levels of service, Standard Positioning Service and the
Precise Positioning Service. The Standard Positioning Service (SPS) is a
positioning and timing service which will be available to all GPS users on a
continuous, worldwide basis with no direct charge. The Precise Positioning
Service (PPS) is a highly accurate military positioning, velocity and timing
service which will be available on a continuous, worldwide basis to users
authorized by the U.S.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">FY-1 is China's meteorological satellite. Multichannel Visible
and IR Scan Radiometer (MVISR) is the major sensor of FY- 1. The
total number of channels of the sensor is increased from 5
channels in FY-1 A and B to 10 channels in FY-1 C and D. These
channels include 4 VIS channels, 3 near IR channels, 1 short
wave IR channel and 2 long wave IR channels.

The instantaneous field of view of the sensor is 1.2 microrad
and the resolution at subpoint is 1.1 Km. The scan rate of MVISR
is still 6 lines/second and total pixel of every scan line is
20480.

The High Resolution Picture Transmission of FY-1 C and D is
named CHRPT. It is considered that the system which receives and
processes HRPT/NOAA- Now data can receive and process CHRPT with
updating as few as possible.

The scan rate of MVISR is 6 lines/second. The words of every
channel are 2048 and the total words of 10 channels are
20480. Plus the sync and auxiliary information there are 22180
words every scan line and 10 bits every word. The bit rate is
1.3308 Mbps, just twice as many as the bit rate of
HRPT/NOAA-Now. The modulation of CHRPT data is PSK and bit
format is split phase. The transmission frequency of CHRPT will
be 1700.5MHz and the data format will be similar to the
HRPT/NOAA-Now data format. Therefore, it will to be easy to
process CHRPT data with HRPT/NOAA-Now data processing system.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">A series of Space Shuttle-Spacelab missions, designated the Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science (ATLAS), is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth.  The series, originally planned to acquire data throughout the Sun's 11-year active cycle, investigated how Earth's atmosphere and climate are affected by the Sun, and by the products of industrial complexes and agricultural activities.  ATLAS 1, the first spacecraft in this series conducted 14 investigations in atmospheric science, solar physics, space plasma physics, and astrophysics.

The 14 ATLAS 1 experiments included:
(1) Atmospheric Lyman-Alpha Emissions (ALAE)
(2) Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS)
(3) Grille Spectrometer (GRILLE)
(4) Imaging Spectrometric Observatory (ISO)
(5) Millimeter-wave Atmospheric Sounder (MAS)
(6) Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Spectrometer (SSBUV-4) -
technically, this instrument was seperate from the ATLAS payload and
was a co-manifested payload
(7) Active Cavity Radiometer Irradiance Monitor (ACRIM)
(8) Solar Spectrum Measurement (SOLSPEC)
(9) Solar Ultraviolet Spectral Irradiance Monitor (SUSIM)
(10) Measurement of the Solar Constant (SOLCON)
(11) Atmospheric Emissions Photometric Imaging (AEPI)
(12) Space Experiments with Particle Accelerators (SEPAC)
(13) Energetic Neutral Atom Precipitation (ENAP). ENAP was not a
seperate instrument but used the ISO instrument measurements
(14) Far Ultraviolet Space Telescope (FAUST)

ATLAS 2 was flown on the STS-56 in April 1993 and consisted of seven of the ATLAS 1 instruments: ATMOS, MAS, SSBUV-5, ACRIM, SOLSPEC, SUSIM, AND SOLCON.

ATLAS 3 was flown on the STS-66 in November 1993 and consisted of the same instruments as ATLAS 2.

These investigations studied the chemical makeup of the atmosphere between approximately 15 and 600 kilometers (8.3 to 330 miles) above the Earth's surface, measured the total energy contained in sunlight and energy variations, investigated how Earth's electric and magnetic fields and atmosphere influence each other, and examined sources of ultraviolet light in the Universe.  The instruments were mounted on two Spacelab pallets in the Shuttle payload bay.  The Shuttle's changing orientation to Earth placed the experiments in advantageous orbiting locations, to observe the atmosphere, the Sun, and astronomical targets.  Specifically, the orbiter orientation was either inertially fixed so that selected instruments were pointed at the sun, or nadir pointed for observations of the Earth's atmosphere. Crew members were in consultation with the investigators while controlling and monitoring the experiments. The atmospheric and solar instruments provided correlative measurements with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).

GOES 3 was launched in June 1978 and was a NASA-developed, NOAA-operated, geosynchronous, and operational spacecraft.  The cylindrically shaped spacecraft measured 190.5 cm in diameter and 230 cm in length, exclusive of a magnetometer that extended an additional 83 cm beyond the cylinder shell.  The primary structural members were a honeycombed equipment shelf and thrust tube. The VISSR telescope was mounted on the equipment shelf and viewed the Earth through a special aperture in the side of the spacecraft.  A support structure extended radially out from the thrust tube and was affixed to the solar panels, which formed the outer walls of the spacecraft and provided the primary source of electrical power.  Located in the annulus-shaped space between the thrust tube and the solar panels were stationkeeping and dynamics control equipment, batteries, and most of the SEM equipment.  Proper spacecraft attitude and spin rate (approximately 100 rpm) were maintained by two separate sets of jet thrusters mounted around the spacecraft equator and activated by ground command.  The spacecraft used both UHF-band and S-band frequencies in its telemetry and command subsystem.  A low-power VHF transponder provided telemetry and command during launch and then served as a backup for the primary subsystem once the spacecraft attained orbit. The spin-stabilized spacecraft carried a visible infrared spin-scan radiometer, meteorological data collection and transmission system, space environment monitor, and a biaxial fluxgate magnetometer.  It operated at 135 degrees West as GOES-WEST.

DMSP 5D-2/F10 is one of a series of meteorological satellites developed and operated by the Air Force under the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). This program, previously known as DAPP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objective of this program is to provide global visual and infrared cloudcover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense operational weather analysis and forecasting requirements. Operationally, the program consists of two satellites in sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other at local noon. The 6.4-m-long spacecraft is separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform for sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment; (2) an equipment support module containing the electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors; (3) a reaction control equipment support structure containing the third-stage rocket motor and supporting the ascent phase reaction control equipment; and (4) a 9.29-sq-m solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization is controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system so that sensors are maintained in the desired earth-looking mode. One feature is the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allows automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element. The operational linescan system is the primary data acquisition system that provides real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night, visual and infrared imagery of clouds. A supplementary sensor package contains five special sensors: (1) a microwave temperature sounder, (2) an advanced X-ray detector, (3) an ionospheric/scintillation monitor, (4) a precipitating electron/ion spectrometer, and (5) a microwave imager. Either recorded or real-time data are transmitted to ground-receiving sites by two redundant S-band transmitters. Recorded data are read out to tracking sites located at Fairchild AFB, Washington, and at Loring AFB, Maine, and relayed by SATCOM to Air Force Global Weather Central, Offutt AFB, Nebraska. Real-time data are read out at mobile tactical sites located around the world. Additional information concerning this satellite can be found in the report by D. A. Nichols, "The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program," Optical Engineering, v. 14, n. 4, p. 273, July-August 1975.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">NASA's Aura is a mission to understand and protect the air we
breathe. With the launch of Aura NASA has begun to make the most
comprehensive measurements of the Earth's atmosphere. It also caps off
a 15-year international effort to establish the world's most
comprehensive Earth Observing System, whose overarching goal is to
determine the extent, causes, and regional consequences of global
change. Aura's objective is to study the chemistry and dynamics of the
Earth's atmosphere with emphasis on the upper troposphere and lower
stratosphere (0-30km) by employing multiple instruments on a single
satellite.  The satellite's measurements enable scientists to
investigate questions about ozone trends, air quality changes and
their linkages to climate change. These observations provide accurate
data for predictive models and provide useful information for local
and national government agencies.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The MetOp-A satellite, developed by a consortium of European companies led by
the main contractor EADS-Astrium, France, builds on the heritage gained from a
successful series of European satellites, including the French Space Agency's
(CNES) SPOT and ESA'S ERS and Envisat.

The satellite consists of a Solar Array and two modules: the Payload Module
(PLM) and the Service Module (SVM). The PLM accommodates the whole suite of
instruments and associated support equipment. It includes advanced versions of
the widely used scatterometer and ozone-monitoring instruments already flying
onboard the ERS-2 satellite. The SVM, which interfaces with the launcher,
provides the main satellite support functions, such as command and control,
communications with the ground, power and orbit control and propulsion. 

MetOp-A carries a set of 'heritage' instruments, provided by the United States
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the French Space
Agency (CNES), and a new generation of European instruments offering precise
sensing capabilities to both meteorologists and climatologists.

NOAA-12 (NOAA-D before launch) is a third-generation operational meteorological satellite for use in the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS). The satellite design provides an economical and stable sun-synchronous (morning equator-crossing) platform for advanced operational instruments to measure the earth's atmosphere, its surface and cloud cover, and the near-space environment. Primary sensors include an Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) for observing daytime and nighttime global radiances and temperatures and a TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) for obtaining temperature and water vapor profiles through the earth's atmosphere. Secondary experiments consist of a Space Environment Monitor (SEM), which measures the proton and electron fluxes near the earth, and an ARGOS Data Collection and Location System, which processes and relays to central data acquisition stations the various meteorological data received from free-floating balloons and ocean buoys distributed around the globe. The satellite is based upon the Block 5D spacecraft bus developed for the U.S. Air Force, and it is capable of maintaining an earth-pointing accuracy of better than plus or minus 0.1 deg with a motion rate of less than 0.035 deg/s. NOAA 12 operations were closed as of April 2001.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">RapidEye is a commercial multispectral remote sensing satellite mission being designed and implemented by MDA for RapidEye AG. The RapidEye sensor images five optical bands in the 400-850nm range and provides 6.5m pixel size at nadir. Rapid delivery and short revisit times are provided through the use of a five-satellite constellation.

It provides products for the following applications:

-Agriculture - crop monitoring and mapping, yield prediction, etc.
-Forestry - tree species separation, stem volume estimation, etc.
-Security &amp; Emergency - disaster management etc.
-Energy &amp; Infrastructure - pipeline monitoring, landcover classification etc.
-Environment - change detection etc.
-Cartography - satellite based maps, ortho photos, etc.
-Other Markets - natural disaster assessment, 3D-visualization, etc.

The satellites will be placed equally spaced in a single sun-synchronous orbit to ensure consistent imaging conditions and a short revisit time. The RapidEye system can access any area on Earth within a day and cover the entire agricultural areas of North America and Europe within five days.

The RapidEye satellite platforms has been constructed by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL). [1] This makes RapidEye the second multiple-satellite imaging constellation that SSTL has been involved with, after building and launching the Disaster Monitoring Constellation.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The IMAGE spacecraft was launched from Vandenberg AFB on March
25, 2000, at 20:34:43 UTC. IMAGE is the first satellite mission
dedicated to imaging the Earth's magnetosphere, the region of
space controlled by the Earth's magnetic field and containing
extremely tenuous plasmas of both solar and terrestrial
origin. Invisible to standard astronomical observing techniques,
these populations of ions and electrons have traditionally been
studied by means of localized measurements with charged particle
detectors, magnetometers, and electric field
instruments. Instead of such in-situ measurements, IMAGE employs
a variety of imaging techniques to "see the invisible" and to
produce the first comprehensive global images of the plasma
populations in the inner magnetosphere. With these images, space
scientists are able to observe, in a way never before possible,
the large-scale dynamics of the magnetosphere and the
interactions among its constituent plasma populations.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The objectives of TIROS (Television Infrared Observation Satellite)
was to test experimental television techniques designed to develop
a worldwide meteorological satellite information system.

The spacecraft was 42 inches in diameter, 19 inches high and
weighed 270 pounds. The craft was made of aluminum alloy and
stainless steel which was then covered by 9200 solar cells. The
solar cells served to charge the on-board batteries. Three pairs
of solid-propellant spin rockets were mounted on the base plate.

Two television cameras were housed in the craft, one
low-resolution and one high-resolution. A magnetic tape recorder
for each camera was supplied for storing photographs while the
satellite was out of range of the ground station network.

The antennas consisted of four rods from the base plate to serve
as transmitters and one vertical rod from the center of the top
plate to serve as a receiver.

The craft was spin-stabilized and space-oriented (not
Earth-oriented). Therefore, the cameras were only operated while
they were pointing at the Earth when that portion of the Earth
was in sunlight.

The video systems relayed thousands of pictures containing
cloud-cover views of the Earth. Early photographs provided
information concerning the structure of large-scale cloud
regimes.

An exciting new astrophysics mission led by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., will provide a revolutionary window into the universe. Named the Gravity and Extreme Magnetism Small Explorer (GEMS), the satellite will be the first to systematically measure the polarization of cosmic X-ray sources.

"To date, astronomers have measured X-ray polarization from only a single object outside the solar system -- the famous Crab Nebula, the luminous cloud that marks the site of an exploded star," said Jean Swank, a Goddard astrophysicist and the GEMS principal investigator. “We expect that GEMS will detect dozens of sources and really open up this new frontier."

Goddard will provide the X-ray mirrors and polarimeter instrument for GEMS and oversee the mission's science operations center, science data processing and systems engineering.

Electromagnetic radiation -- light, radio waves, X-rays -- contains a varying electric field. Polarization refers to this field's direction. An everyday example of putting polarization to use is as close as a pair of sunglasses. Reflected light contains an electric field with a specific orientation. Because polarized sunglasses block light vibrating in this direction, they can reduce the glare of reflected sunlight.

The extreme gravitational field near a spinning black hole not only bends the paths of X-rays, it also alters the directions of their electric fields. Polarization measurements can reveal the presence of a black hole and provide astronomers with information on its spin. Fast-moving electrons emit polarized X-rays as they spiral through intense magnetic fields, providing GEMS with the means to explore another aspect of extreme environments.

"Thanks to these effects, GEMS can probe spatial scales far smaller than any telescope can possibly image," Swank said. Polarized X-rays carry information about the structure of cosmic sources that isn't available in any other way.

DMSP F16 (USA 172) was launched by a Titan 2 rocket from Vandenberg AFB at 16:17 UT on 18 October 2003. The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) is a Department of Defense (DoD) program run by the Air Force Space and Missle Systems Center (SMC). The program designs, builds, launches, and maintains satellites monitoring the meteorological, oceanographic, and solar-terrestrial physics environments. Each DMSP satellite has a 101 minute, sun-synchronous near-polar orbit at an altitude of 830km above the surface of the earth. The visible and infrared sensors (OLS) collect images across a 3000 km swath, providing global coverage twice per day. The combination of day/night and dawn/dusk satellites allows monitoring of global information such as clouds every 6 hours. The microwave imager (SSMI) and sounders (SSMT1, SSMT2) cover one half the width of the visible and infrared swath. These instruments cover polar regions at least twice and the equatorial region once per day. The space environment sensors (SSJ, SSM, SSIES) record along-track plasma densities, velocities, composition and drifts (SS stands for Special Sensor).

DMSP F16 carries two new experiments: the limb scanning ultraviolet imager/spectrometer SSULI built by the Naval Research Laboratory and the nadir scanning ultaviolet imager/spectrometer and photometer SSUSI built by the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University. It also carried new versions of the Special Sensor for Ions, Electrons and Scintillations (SSIES-13) and of the precipitating ion and electron monitor (SSJ-5)

The data from the DMSP satellites are received and used at operational centers continuously. The data are sent to the National Geophysical Data Center's Solar Terrestrial Physics Division (NGDC/STP) by the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) for creation of an archive.

update Definition (Terra is the flagship satellite of NASA's Earth observing
systems. Terra is the first EOS (Earth Observing System) platform and provides
global data on the state of the atmosphere, land, and oceans, as well as their
interactions with solar radiation and with one another.

Since the 1950&amp;#039;s, it has become increasingly clear that human activities are
modifying the composition of the atmosphere on a global scale. As the result of
industrialization, the concentration of carbon dioxide has increased by about
20% during this period. More recently, the stratospheric concentrations of
chemically-active gases containing chlorine, bromine, and fluorine have
dramatically increased. These trends have created issues of global interest
including global warming and declining levels of ozone (both globally and in
the ozone &amp;hole&amp; in the Antarctic). It has become increasingly clear, however,
that these processes do not occur independently of one another and can only be
understood in the context of a global system. Accurate and precise measurements
are needed to unravel complex and interactive relationships between chemical,
radiative, and dynamical processes in the atmosphere, ocean, and on land. As a
result, in 1991 NASA initiated a comprehensive program to understand the
Earth&amp;#039;s atmosphere, oceans, land, and cryosphere (ice and snow) as a single,
complex, interactive system. NASA&amp;#039;s Earth Observing System (EOS) consists of a
series of spaceborne instruments to monitor crucial components of the Earth
system, an advanced data handling system, and teams of scientists who will
evaluate on-going climate change and predict future changes. Ultimately, EOS
will produce scientifically sound recommendations for environmental policy to
national and international bodies to mitigate or prepare for these changes.

The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program F18 (DMSP F18) satellite will help the Air Force provide “strategic and tactical weather prediction … to aide the U.S. military in planning operations at sea, on land, and in the air,” notes the ULA mission over presentation.

Furthermore, “DMSP is a space- and ground-based system to collect and disseminate timely global environmental data to the Department of Defense and other governmental agencies.”

DMSP F18 will provide viable data on soil moisture, surface temperatures, and cloud cover around the globe via its multitude of onboard sensors and polar orbit.

The presentation goes on to discuss some specifics of the DMSP satellite system, of which F18 is a part. “DMSP satellites ’see’ environmental features such as clouds, bodies of water, snow, fire, and pollution in the visual and infrared spectra.”

The satellite system can monitor global water temperatures, cloud cover, water currents, and ocean surface characteristics during their 101-minute orbital period around Earth. This, coupled with their polar and “sun-synchronous” orbits, allows each DMSP weather satellite to monitor nearly the entire globe every six hours.

The data collected by the satellites is transmitted to the ground where a team of meteorologists interpret the data and disseminate the information for the U.S. military, which in turn uses the data to plan and conduct U.S. military operations around the globe.

In addition to DMSP F18, two more DMSP weather satellites are awaiting launch. These satellites are currently stored at Space Systems’ operations in Sunnyvale, California. They will be transported to Vandenberg upon the request of the Air Force for launch operations.

Complex 37 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, Florida at 6:11 pm EDT on May
25, 2006.

GOES-13 (GOES-N) is the latest in a series of Earth monitoring satellites.
Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) provide the kind of
continuous monitoring necessary for intensive data analysis. Geostationary
describes an orbit in which a satellite is always in the same position with
respect to the rotating Earth. This allows GOES to hover continuously over one
position on the Earth's surface, appearing stationary. As a result, GOES
provide a constant vigil for the atmospheric "triggers" for severe weather
conditions such as tornadoes, flash floods, hail storms, and hurricanes.

The Delta II carrying NOAA-N Prime lifted off Feb. 6, 2009 at 2:22 a.m. Pacific time, 5:22 a.m. Eastern time from Space Launch Complex-2 at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.

[Image and Text Source: NOAA-N Prime Spacecraft web page, http://goespoes.gsfc.nasa.gov/poes/spacecraft/noaanprime_spacecraft.html ]

NOAA-N Prime will be the last in the series of TIROS ATN. NOAA-N' has a planned launch date of February 2009 from Vandenberg AFB, CA by a Delta II launch vehicle.

The spacecraft will continue to provide a polar-orbiting platform to support (1) environmental monitoring instruments for imaging and measuring the Earth's atmosphere, its surface, and cloud cover, including Earth radiation, atmospheric ozone, aerosol distribution, sea surface temperature, and vertical temperature and water profiles in the troposphere and stratosphere; (2) measurement of proton and electron flux at orbit altitude; (3) data collection from remote platforms; and (4) the Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking (SARSAT) system.

Additionally, NOAA-N' will be the fifth in the series of support dedicated microwave instruments for the generation of temperature, moisture, surface, and hydrological products in cloudy regions where visible and infrared (IR) instruments have decreased capability.

This spacecraft will carry an Advanced - DCS instead of the previous DCS.

Meteosat First Generation refers to a series of geostationary satellites that have provided images of the full Earth disc and data for weather forecasts in a continuous and reliable stream for a quarter of a century. The first Meteosat, Meteosat-1, was launched in 1977, and the last of the first generation, Meteosat-7, was launched 20 years later, in 1997.

More Information:
http://www.eumetsat.int/Home/Main/Satellites/MeteosatFirstGeneration/index.htm?l=en

Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) consists of a series of four geostationary meteorological satellites, along with ground-based infrastructure, that will operate consecutively until 2020. The MSG satellites carry an impressive pair of instruments, the Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager (SEVIRI), which has the capacity to observe the Earth in 12 spectral channels and provide image data which is core to operational forecasting needs, and the Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget (GERB) instrument supporting climate studies.

More Information: 
http://www.eumetsat.int/Home/Main/Satellites/MeteosatSecondGeneration/MissionOverview/index.htm?l=en


The Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) system is being established through cooperation between EUMETSAT and the European Space Agency (ESA). ESA has already contributed to the initial research and development of the new satellites. The first MTG-I and MTG-S prototypes are being developed by ESA as part of its MTG programme. The EUMETSAT MTG programme includes the procurement of the four recurrent satellites - three MTG-Is and one additional MTG-S - as well as six launches, the development of the ground segment and the operations of all satellites.

The Euronews video (right) provides a useful introduction to past and future developments in European satellite meteorology, with particular reference to the MTG programme.
The MTG series will comprise six satellites, with the first spacecraft likely to be ready for launch from 2017. The in orbit configuration will consist of two parallel positioned satellites, the MTG-I (imager) and the MTG-S (sounder) platforms. Unlike the  first and second generation Meteosat series, MTG will be based on three axes stabilised platforms having the advantage that the instruments are 100% of their in orbit time pointed to the Earth.  Such improvements are necessary to achieve compliance with more demanding user requirements on spatial resolution, repeat cycle and signal to noise ratio, and are a prerequisite to conduct soundings from geostationary orbit.
MTG-I satellites will fly the Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) and an imaging lightning detection instrument the Lightning Imager (LI). The MTG-S will include an interferometer the InfraRed Sounder (IRS) with hyper-spectral resolution in the thermal spectral domain, and the Sentinel-4 instrument, the high resolution Ultraviolet Visible Near-infrared (UVN) spectrometer.
The programme should guarantee access to space-acquired meteorological data until at least the late 2030s.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Douglas DC-6 was one of the first airplanes to fly a regularly scheduled around-the-world route. With its higher performance, increased accommodation, greater payload and pressurized cabin, it was a natural evolution of the DC-4.

Although the DC-6 had the same wingspan as the DC-4, its engines helped it fly 90 mph faster than the DC-4, carry 3,000 pounds more payload and fly 850 miles farther. The DC-6 could maintain the cabin pressure of 5,000 feet while flying at 20,000 feet.

American Airlines and United Airlines ordered the commercial DC-6 in 1946, and Pan American Airways used the DC-6 to start tourist-class service across the North Atlantic. The 29th DC-6 was ordered by the Air Force, adapted as the presidential aircraft and designated the VC-118. It was delivered on July 1, 1947, and called The Independence after President Harry Truman's hometown, Independence, Mo.

The larger, all-cargo DC-6A first flew Sept. 29, 1949; the larger capacity DC-6B, which could seat up 102 people, first flew Feb. 10, 1951. After the Korean War broke out in 1951, the military ordered DC-6As modified as either C-118A "Liftmaster" personnel carriers, as the Navy's R6D transports or as MC-118As for aeromedical evacuation. Between 1947 and 1959, Douglas built a total of 704 DC-6s, 167 of them military versions. By 1998, the DC-6 was still flying with smaller airlines around the world.

MSP F15 (USA 147) was launched by a Titan rocket from Vandenberg AFB on December 12, 1999 into a 101 minute, sun-synchronous near-polar orbit at an altitude of 840km and with the Local Time nodes of 21:10 and 9:10. The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) is a Department of Defense (DoD) program run by the Air Force Space and Missle Systems Center (SMC). The program designs, builds, launches, and maintains satellites monitoring the meteorological, oceanographic, and solar-terrestrial physics environments. Each DMSP satellite has a above the surface of the earth. The visible and infrared sensors (OLS) collect images across a 3000 km swath, providing global coverage twice per day. The combination of day/night and dawn/dusk satellites allows monitoring of global information such as clouds every 6 hours. The microwave imager (MI) and sounders (T1, T2) cover one half the width of the visible and infrared swath. These instruments cover polar regions at least twice and the equatorial region once per day. The space environment sensors (J4, M, IES) record along-track plasma densities, velocities, composition and drifts. The data from the DMSP satellites are received and used at operational centers continuously. The data are sent to the National Geophysical Data Center's Solar Terrestrial Physics Division (NGDC/STP) by the Air Force Weather Agency (AFWA) for creation of an archive.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Geostationary Meteorological Satellite (GMS-1) was Japan's contribution to the international GARP (Global Atmospheric Research Program).  One major objective of GARP was to obtain synoptic global meteorological data sets for one year's duration (to include two optimized observing periods of a few weeks each).  These data served as raw material to optimize computer models for meteorological prediction.  It was hoped that determination could be made of the time limitation for short-term modeling.  The GMS series has been used for the World Meteorological Organization's World Weather Watch. The satellite was spin-stabilized with a despun earth-pointing antenna.  The GMS series carried the Visible and Spin Scan Radiometer (VISSR).  Launched by a US Delta rocket in July 1977, the satellite was positioned near 140 deg E.  Designed to operate for 5 years, the satellite was turned off in 1981 after 4 1/2 years in orbit.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Pioneer 6 was the first of four NASA spacecraft designed to study interplanetary phenomena in space. The spacecraft successfully provided simultaneous scientific measurements at widely dispersed locations in heliocentric orbit. It returned the first data on the tenuous solar atmosphere and later recorded the passage of Comet Kohoutek's tail in 1974. 

Along with Pioneers 7, 8, and 9, the spacecraft formed a ring of solar weather stations spaced along Earth's orbit. Measurements by the four Pioneers were used to predict solar storms for approximately 1,000 primary users, including the Federal Aviation Administration; commercial airlines; power companies; communication companies; military organizations; and entities involved in surveying, navigation, and electronic prospecting. 

By December 1990, Pioneer 6 had circled the Sun twentynine times (traveling 24.8 billion kilometers) and had been operational for twenty years -- a record for a deep space probe. Its original slated lifetime had been only six months. 

On 15 December 1996, the spacecraft's primary transmitter failed, but during a track on 11 July 1996, ground controllers switched on the backup transmitter. 

Of the spacecraft's six scientific instruments, two (the plasma analyzer and the cosmic-ray detector) still continue to function. 

NASA maintains contact with the spacecraft once or twice each year. For example, 1 hour's worth of scientific data was collected on 29 July and 15 December 1995 (although the primary transmitter failed soon after that), and again on 6 October 1997, more than thirty years after launch. The probe's solar arrays continue to deteriorate, although the transmitters can be turned on at perihelion when the solar flux is strong enough to provide sufficient power. 

On 8 December 2000, to commemorate its thirty-fifth anniversary of operation, ground controllers established successful contact with the spacecraft for about 2 hours.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">                  - Spacecraft Brief Description -
ISIS 1 was an ionospheric observatory instrumented with sweep- and
fixed-frequency ionosondes, a VLF receiver, energetic and soft particle
detectors, an ion mass spectrometer, an electrostatic probe, an electrostatic
analyzer, a beacon transmitter, and a cosmic noise experiment. The sounder used
two dipole antennas (73 and 18.7 m long). The satellite was spin-stabilized at
about 2.9 rpm after antenna deployment. Some control was exercised over the
spin rate and attitude by using magnetically induced torques to change the spin
rate and to precess the spin axis. A tape recorder with 1-h capacity was
included on the satellite. The satellite could be programmed to take recorded
observations for four different time periods for each full recording period.
The recorder data were dumped only at Ottawa. For non-tape-recorded
observations, data for the satellite and subsatellite regions could be acquired
and telemetered when the spacecraft was in the line of sight of telemetry
stations. The selected telemetry stations were in areas that provided primary
data coverage near the 80-deg-W meridian and in areas near Hawaii, Singapore,
Australia, England, Norway, India, Japan, Antarctica, New Zealand, and Central
Africa. NASA support of the ISIS project was terminated on October 1, 1979. A
significant amount of experimental data, however, was acquired after this date
by the Canadian project team. ISIS 1 operations were terminated in Canada on
March 9, 1984. The Radio Research Laboratories (Tokyo, Japan) then requested
and received permission to reactivate ISIS 1. Regular ISIS 1 operations were
started from Kashima, Japan, in early August 1984. ISIS 1 was deactivated
effective January 24, 1990.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Global Atmospherics, Inc's large-area Lightning Position and Tracking System (LPATS) is a highly-accurate and sophisticated computer-based system using a time-of-arrival (TOA) technique for locating cloud-to-ground lightning strokes.  This system has been installed throughout the U.S. to form the LPATS National Network (LN2).  The precise time that lightning touches the ground is monitored to sub microsecond accuracy at several receiver sites simultaneously. Available data include stroke position, energy, rise time, probability, counting, and ranging, along with color tracking, time of incidence, and storm historic events on a national or regional scale.  LPATS networks also currently exist in Europe, South America, and Asia.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are remotely piloted or self-piloted aircraft that can carry cameras, sensors, communications equipment or other payloads. They have been used in a reconnaissance and intelligence-gathering role since the 1950s, and more challenging roles are envisioned, including combat missions. Since 1964 the Defense Department has developed 11 different UAVs, though due to acquisition and development problems only 3 entered production. The US Navy has studyied the feasibility of operating VTOL UAVs since the early 1960s, the QH-50 Gyrodyne torpedo-delivery drone being an early example. However, high cost and technological immaturity have precluded acquiring and fielding operational VTOL UAV systems.

By the early 1990s DOD sought UAVs to satisfy surveillance requirements in Close Range, Short Range or Endurance categories. Close Range was defined to be within 50 kilometers, Short Range was defined as within 200 kilometers and Endurance as anything beyond. By the late 1990s, the Close and Short Range categories were combined, and a separate Shipboard category emerged. The current classes of these vehicles are the Tactical UAV and the Endurance category.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Spacecraft Brief Description
  The   GEOS   2   (Geodetic   Earth   Orbiting   Satellite)   was  a
  gravity-gradient-stabilized,    solar-cell-powered   spacecraft   that
  carried   electronic   and  geodetic  instrumentation.   The  geodetic
  instrumentation  systems  included  (1)  four optical beacons, (2) two
  C-band  radar  transponders,  (3)  a  passive  radar  reflector, (4) a
  sequential  collation  of range radio range transponder, (5) a Goddard
  range  and  range  rate  transponder,  (6)  laser  reflectors, and (7)
  Doppler beacons.  Non-geodetic systems included a laser detector and a
  Minitrack  interferometer  beacon.   The  objectives of the spacecraft
  were  to  optimize  optical  station visibility periods and to provide
  complementary  data for inclination-dependent terms established by the
  Explorer  29  (GEOS 1) gravimetric studies.  The spacecraft was placed
  into  a  retrograde orbit to accomplish these objectives.  Operational
  problems  occurred  in  the  main  power  system, optical beacon flash
  system,  and  the  spacecraft  clock,  and  adjustments  in scheduling
  resulted in nominal operations.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The HESSI mission consists of a single spin-stabilized spacecraft in a low-altitude orbit inclined 38 degrees to the Earth's equator. The only instrument on board is an imaging spectrometer with the ability to obtain high fidelity color movies of solar flares in X rays and gamma rays. It uses two new complementary technologies: fine grids to modulate the solar radiation, and germanium detectors to measure the energy of each photon very precisely. 

HESSI's imaging capability is achieved with fine tungsten and/or molybdenum grids that modulate the solar X-ray flux as the spacecraft rotates at ~ 15 rpm. Up to 20 detailed images can be obtained per second. This is sufficient to track the electrons as they travel from their acceleration site, believed to be in the solar corona, and slow down on their way to the lower solar atmosphere. 

The high-resolution spectroscopy is achieved with 9 cooled germanium crystals that detect the X-ray and gamma-ray photons transmitted through the grids over the broad energy range of 3 keV to 20 MeV. Their fine energy resolution of about 1 keV is more than sufficient to reveal the detailed features of the X-ray and gamma-ray spectra, clues to the nature of the electron and ion acceleration processes. 

A spinning spacecraft pointing at or near Sun center provides a simple and reliable way to achieve the rotation required for the HESSI imaging technique. A low-altitude equatorial orbit that can be reached with a Pegasus launch vehicle is chosen to minimize damage to the germanium detectors from the charged particles in the Earth's radiation belts. 

Context observations from ground-based observatories and a theory program are also integral parts of the HESSI mission. Ground-based optical and radio telescopes will provide complementary data on the magnetic fields, electric currents, hot plasma, and the energetic electrons in the flaring regions where the X-ray and gamma-ray emissions are generated. Also, it is hoped that other spacecraft will provide additional simultaneous observations of the thermal and dynamic environment to further enhance our knowledge of the conditions in the flaring region.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The THEOS contract with the Thai Ministry of Science and Technology's Space Agency (GISTDA) includes the production and launch of one optical observation satellite, as well as the development of the ground segment necessary to operate and control the satellite directly from Thailand. This is accompanied by state of the art facilities for image archiving and processing. The THEOS satellite is based on EADS Astrium's new generation of high performance AstroSat optical Earth observation satellites and benefits from the company's extensive experience in this field which started with the SPOT and MetOp satellites.

As part of the THEOS contract, Thai engineers will join the Astrium development team and attend intensive space programme training. The company firmly believes that this cooperation contract paves the way for further development of GISTDA and space activities in Thailand.

The THEOS payload features both high resolution in panchromatic mode (2m) and wide field of view in multi-spectral mode and has been tailored to Thailand's specific needs with a worldwide imaging capability. It will be launched in 2008 on a sun synchronous orbit at an altitude of around 820km.

THEOS will be fully owned and operated by GISTDA and will provide Thailand with worldwide geo-referenced image products and image processing capabilities for applications in cartography, land use, agricultural monitoring, forestry management, coastal zone monitoring and flood risk management. THEOS will provide access to any part of Thailand in less than two days.

The GOES-O satellite lifted off from Launch Complex 37 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida at 6:51 p.m. EDT [2009-06-27] atop a Delta IV rocket. From a position about 22,300 miles above Earth, the advanced weather satellite will keep an unblinking eye on atmospheric conditions in the Eastern United States and Atlantic Ocean.

Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES)-O represents a continuation of the newest generation of environmental satellites built by Boeing  for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under the technical guidance and project management of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD. GOES satellites provide the familiar weather pictures seen on United States television newscasts every day. The GOES imaging and sounding instruments (built by ITT) feature flexible scans for small-scale area viewing in regions of the visible and infrared spectrum allowing meteorologists to improve short-term forecasts. GOES provides nearly continuous imaging and sounding, which allow forecasters to better measure changes in atmospheric temperature and moisture distributions and hence increase the accuracy of their forecasts. GOES environmental information is used for a host of applications, including weather monitoring and prediction models, ocean temperatures and moisture locations, climate studies, cryosphere (ice, snow, glaciers) detection and extent, land temperatures and crop conditions, and hazards detection. The GOES-O&amp;P Imagers have improved resolution in the 13 micrometer channel from 8 km to 4 km. The finer spatial resolution allows an improved cloud-top product, height of atmospheric motion vectors and volcanic ash detection. GOES-O continues the improved image navigation and registration, additional power and fuel lifetime capability, space weather, solar x-ray imaging, search and rescue, and communication services as provided on GOES-13.

GOES-P is also in ground storage following the completion of environmental testing and is prepared for an April 2009 launch readiness with a July 2010, engineering handover date requirement.

"http://www.fimr.fi/en/aranda/laiva.html"]

The modern Aranda was launched in Helsinki in June 1989. It is first research
vessel which is owned by the Finnish Institute of Marine Research, and its home
port is Helsinki. The length of the ship is 59,2 m, its beam 13,8 m and gross
register weight 1734 GT. The ship accomodates a research staff of 25 - 30
persons.

Aranda is a modern, ice-reinforced research vessel. She was planned for Baltic
Sea research, but in principle, she is able to operate in all seas. Aranda has
made scientific expeditions i.a. to Antarctic waters and the Northern Atlantic.
The vessel is adapted to year-round multidisciplinary marine research,
including biology, physics, chemistry and geology of the sea. The well-equipped
laboratories and advanced computer systems facilitate sample treatment and data
analysis under way.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Introduction

This mission was studied in France in the context of GEWEX (Global Energy and Water cycle Experiment). For understanding tropical meteorological and climatic processes, it appeared necessary to obtain reliable statistics on the water and energy budget of the tropical atmosphere and to describe the evolution of its systems (monsoons, cyclones, …) at appropriate time scales. In parallel, tropical atmospheric and oceanic missions were also studied in India, which is directly concerned by these phenomena. The first originality of MEGHA-TROPIQUES is to associate three radiometric instruments allowing to observe simultaneously three interrelated components of the atmospheric engine : water vapour, condensed water (clouds and precipitations), and radiative fluxes. The second is to privilege the sampling of the intertropical zone, accounting for the large time-space variability of the tropical phenomena. Moreover, the MEGHA-TROPIQUES microwave radiometer MADRAS could be one element complementing the constellation of mini-satellites of the Global Precipitation Mission .
Scientific objectives

- to improve the knowledge of the water cycle in the intertropical region, to evaluate its consequences on the energy budget,

- to study the life cycle of tropical convective systems over ocean and continents, the environmental conditions for their appearance and evolution, their water budget, and the associated transports of water vapor.
Applied objectives

- to provide data about the processes leading to dramatic weather events affecting the Tropical countries, as hurricanes, systems producing heavy rainfalls, processes governing monsoons variability or droughts.
Mission Scenario

The key of this mission is the repetitivity of the measurement in the Tropics. The orbit of the platform must be in a low inclination on the equatorial plane. The altitude of the orbit has to be high enough to allow a wide swath of the instruments.
Geophysical parameters to be retrieved:

Atmospheric water cycle elements: Water vapor (integrated and vertical distribution), cloud condensed water content, ice/water, precipitation.

Radiative budget elements: solar reflected and terrestrial emitted fluxes at the top of the atmosphere.
Instrumental payload

The instruments have to be complementary to what exists on geostationary satellites (VIS-IR imagers). Microwave instruments are then fundamental. The main payload instruments are:

- A microwave imager (MADRAS) aimed mainly to study precipitation and cloud properties, including ice at the top of clouds (SSM/I type, with an additional channel at 157 GHz).

- A microwave sounding instrument for the atmospheric water vapor (SAPHIR - 6 channels in the 183 GHz band).

- A radiometer devoted to the measurement of outgoing radiative fluxes at the top of the atmosphere (ScaRaB).

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">     The world's first operational weather satellite system was placed into
service with the launching of the Environmental Science Services
Administration (which in 1970 became the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, NOAA) satellites, ESSA-1, on February 3, 1966, and ESSA-2, on
February 28, 1966.  The objective of this program, also called the TIROS
Operational System (TOS), was to acquire global observational data routinely on
a daily basis.  This system consisted of a pair of ESSA satellites in
sun-synchronous (polar) orbit.  The odd numbered satellites (ESSA-1, 3, 5, 7,
and 9) utilized the Advanced Vidicon Camera System (AVCS) to obtain global
imagery which were transmitted to the ESSA Command and Data Acquition (CDA)
stations at Wallops, Virginia, and Fairbanks, Alaska.  The CDA stations relayed
the data to the National Environmental Satellite Service (NESS), which later
became the National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service
(NESDIS), located in Suitland, Maryland, for processing and distribution to
forecasting centers of the U.S. and other nations.  The even numbered
satellites (ESSA-2, 4, 6, and 8) were equipped with Automatic Picture
Transmission (APT) TV cameras which transmitted television pictures directly to
ground stations worldwide.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Space Radar Laboratory - 1  (SRL-1) was launched onboard the Space Shuttle "Endeavor" (STS-59) on April 9, 1994.  The SRL-1 consists of two elements: a suite of radar instruments called the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR) jointly developed by NASA and DARA of Germany and ASI of Italy, and the Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellite (MAPS) instrument to measure atmospheric air pollution. SRL-1 is the first in a series of flights of this payload designed to (1) acquire radar imagery of the Earth's surface for studies in geology, geography, hydrology, oceanography, agronomy, and botany; (2) gather data for future space-borne radar systems;  and (3) provide measurements of the global distribution of carbon monoxide (CO) in the troposphere. Instruments on board include the Shuttle Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C) with multi-frequency (C- and  L-Bands), multi-polarization (HH, VV, HV, VH), and multi-incidence angle (15 to 55  degrees) capabilities thus lending itself to a wide range of earth surface applications; the X-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (X-SAR), an X-band, VV-polarized imaging radar system, built by Dornier (Germany) and Alenia (Italy) for the German Space Agency (DARA)/German Aerospace Research Establishment (DLR) and the Italian Space Agency (ASI); and, the Mapping Air Pollution from Space (MAPS) instrument for the study of global air pollution. The MAPS instrument, from NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) is part of NASA's Mission to Planet Earth (MtPE) Program.  Four 45-Mbps data channels were recorded on special high data rate tape recorders and real-time data was transmitted to ground stations. About 50 hours each of SIR-C and X-SAR data were recorded during the mission. The combined SIR-C/X-SAR Science Team was made up of 49 members and 3 associates representing 13 countries. SIR-C/X-SAR data collection was focused on several worldwide supersites and correlated with ground and aircraft measurements. Radar data was also calibrated to allow comparisons with other operating spaceborne radars (ERS-1 SAR, JERS-1 SAR).

Both SIR-C and X-SAR will use on-board tape recorders to store data as well as limited real-time transmissions to the ground. Each radar has its own on-board data handling system and each radar can have its data routed through the TDRSS for real-time transmission (Ku-band). SIR-C data are recorded in parallel and X-SAR data is recorded serially. SIR-C and X-SAR data will be preprocessed at the Payload Operations Control Center (POCC) at NASA/JSC before delivery to JPL and operations centers in Germany and Italy. Commands are sent to the SRL-1 from POCC. At mission end, data tapes recorded on-board are sent to the PI sites.

The SIR-C/X-SAR part of the SRL-1 mission is expected to collect over 50 hours of data, both recorded and real-time. Real-time raw data will be pre-processed by the instrument PIs and science teams and stored at the PI sites at JPL, in Germany, and in Italy for analysis. SIR-C data will be processed at JPL using the JPL advanced digital SAR processor, leading to processed SAR images on 8-mm digital tape and on film. Plans include the production of CD-ROMs with 100 m resolution images. X-SAR data will be pre-processed within 3 months. Image products will be made available to X-SAR investigators. Both Germany and Italy will operate separate archives and processing facilities for X-SAR data. SIR-C processed data will eventually be be archived with the EOSDIS DAAC at EROS Data Center. All processed MAPS data is expected to be archived with the EOSDIS DAAC at NASA/Langley. Two additional flights of SRL are planned (August 1994 and 1995).

Some SIR-C and X-SAR images are publically available on the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) FTP site: jplinfo.jpl.nasa.gov in the directory /sircxsar. The images are also available through the World Wide Web (WWW) at http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/. Both servers also have extensive information about the mission.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) are unoccupied, highly maneuverable underwater robots operated by a person aboard a surface vessel. They are linked to the ship by a group of cables that carry electrical signals back and forth between the operator and the vehicle. Most are equipped with at least a video camera and lights. Additional equipment is commonly added to expand the vehicle's capabilities. These may include a still camera, a manipulator or cutting arm, water samplers, and instruments that measure water clarity, light penetration, and temperature. First developed for industrial purposes, such as internal and external inspections of pipelines and the structural testing of offshore platforms, ROVs are now used for many applications, many of them scientific. They have proven extremely valuable in ocean exploration, and are also used for educational programs at aquaria and to link to scientific expeditions live via the internet.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Meteosat-1 was launched in November 1977 and was a geostationary
spacecraft that served as part of European Space Agency's (ESA)
contribution to the Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP).  As
part of GARP, the satellite helped to supply data required for global
data sets used in improvement of machine weather forecasts.  In
general, the spacecraft design, instrumentation, and operation were
similar to SMS/GOES.  The cylindrically shaped spacecraft measured 210
cm in diameter and 430 cm in length, including the apogee boost motor.
The primary structural members were an equipment platform and a
central tube. The radiometer telescope was mounted on the equipment
platform and viewed the earth through a special aperture in the side
of the spacecraft. A support structure extended radially out from the
central tube and was affixed to the solar panels, which formed the
outer walls of the spacecraft and provided the primary source of
electrical power.  Located in the annulus-shaped space between the
central tube and the solar panels were station-keeping and dynamics
control equipment and batteries. Proper spacecraftattitude and spin
rate (approximately 100 rpm) were maintained by jet thrusters mounted
on the spacecraft and activated by ground command. The spacecraft used
both UHF-band and S-band frequencies in its telemetry and command
subsystems.  A low-power VHF transponder provided telemetry and
command during launch and then served as a backup for the primary
subsystem once the spacecraft attained synchronous orbit.
The spin-stabilized spacecraft carried (1) a visible-IR radiometer to
provide high-quality day/night cloudcover data and to take radiance
temperatures of the earth/atmosphere system, and (2) a meteorological
data collection system to disseminate image data to user stations, to
collect data from various earth-based platforms, and to relay data
from polar-orbiting satellites.  Meteosat-1 was originally placed in a
geosynchronous orbit near the prime meridian and was positioned later
between 9 and 11 degrees East.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The ITOS (Improved Tiros Operational Satellite) series (TIROS-M
was the prototype spacecraft) were the second generation of
operational sun-synchronous meteorological
spacecraft. Operational satellites were renamed NOAA.

The primary objective of ITOS was to provide improved
operational infrared and visual observations of earth cloud
cover for use in weather analysis and forecasting. Secondary
objectives included providing both solar proton and global heat
balance data on a regular daily basis. To accomplish these
tasks, the spacecraft carried:

-two television cameras for Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) and
-two Advanced Vidicon Camera System (AVCS) cameras. It also carried
-a low-resolution Flat Plate Radiometer (FPR),
-a Solar Proton Monitor (SPM), and
-two scanning radiometers that not only measured emitted infrared
radiation, but also served as a backup system for the APT and AVCS
cameras.

The nearly cubical spacecraft measured 1 by 1 by 1.2 m. The TV
cameras and infrared sensors were mounted on the satellite
baseplate with their optical axes directed verticially
earthward. The satellite was equipped with three curved solar
panels that were folded during launch and deployed after orbit
was achieved. Each panel measured over 4.2 m in length when
unfolded and was covered with 3420 solar cells, each measuring 2
by 2 cm. The ITOS dynamics and attitude control system
maintained desired spacecraft orientation through gyroscopic
principles incorporated into the satellite design. Earth
orientation of the satellite body was maintained by taking
advantage of the precession induced from a momentum flywheel so
that the satellite body precession rate of one revolution per
orbit provided the desired 'earth looking' attitude. Minor
adjustments in attitude and orientation were made by means of
magnetic coils and by varying the speed of the momentum
flywheel.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">For the STS-9 mission Columbia was once again back in orbit.The launch occurred at ll a.m. EST, Nov. 28, 1983, after a 2-month delay because of a nozzle problem with one of the SRBs. This necessitated moving the vehicle back to the Vehicle Assembly Building where the nozzle was replaced.

The 6-member crew -- a manned space flight record at the time -- included John W. Young, commander, on his second Shuttle flight; Brewster H. Shaw, pilot; Owen Garriott and Robert A. Parker, both mission specialists; and Byron K. Lichtenberg and Ulf Merbold payload specialists -- the first two non-astronauts to fly on the Shuttle. Merbold, a citizen of West Germany, also was the first foreign citizen to participate in a Shuttle flight.  Lichtenberg was a researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Communications/Navigation Outage Forecasting System (C/NOFS) is a prototype operational system designed to monitor and forecast ionospheric scintillation in real-time and on a global scale. Timely location of scintillation outage regions would enable the warfighter to modify mission plans and prevent potential mission failures by optimizing and tailoring communications routes, paths, and/or priorities and effectively use satellite communications, navigation, and surveillance assets. It will include three critical elements. The first is a space-borne sensor system consisting of seven proven sensors to provide data for global, real-time specification, and 4 hour forecast capability. The second is a series of regional ground networks that augment the space based sensors for real time, high resolution coverage in theater. The third is a forecasting/decision aid software package that produces tailored space environmental forecasts and warnings in the form of outage maps for the warfighter.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Dash (Density And Scale Height) satellites were
2.5-m-diameter balloons used to measure air densities at
altitudes of approximately 3500 km. The area-to-mass ratio for
the spacecraft was 40 sq cm/g. The orbit, originally circular,
increased in eccentricity rapidly under the action of solar
radiation pressure. This experiment used the variations in orbit
characteristics of the Dash balloon satellite to deduce neutral
air densities and to study the effect of solar radiation
pressure. Other effects, such as terrestrial radiation pressure,
lunar gravity, and solar gravity were also observable.

Dash 2 reentered the earth's atmosphere on April 12, 1971.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The newest SAGE mission, SAGE III on ISS, is scheduled to launch in 2014. Plans include sending a copy of the SAGE III instrument to the International Space Station aboard a commercial Space X flight.

SAGE III was a fourth generation, satellite-borne instrument and a crucial element in NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) . The instrument was launched on the Russian Meteor-3M spacecraft in December 2001. The Meteor-3M mission, along with the SAGE III mission, was terminated on March 6, 2006, because of a power supply system failure resulting in loss of communication with the satellite.

The SAGE III mission enhanced our understanding of natural and human-derived atmospheric processes by providing accurate measurements of the vertical structure of aerosols, ozone, water vapor, and other important trace gases in the upper troposphere and stratosphere.

Human-derived changes in climate and ozone threaten the health of our planet. They also threaten global economic development and the use of new technologies like high-speed aircraft.

By understanding the effect of human activities on the atmosphere, national and international leaders can make informed policy that mitigates or prepares for future climate change.

The SAGE III-Meteor-3M Version 3 revised data set, which includes improvements to solar ozone, nitrogen dioxide and aerosol extinction products, is publicly available at NASA Langley's Atmospheric Science Data Center . The data set also includes the release of a cloud presence identifier and lunar data products. These data will cover the period 27 February 2002 - Present. IDL users will need to access the reader software that must be matched with this version of the data set.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Studies of the sun, the upper reaches of Earth's atmosphere and astronomical objects using an international array of instruments in Atlantis' cargo bay will highlight Shuttle Mission STS-45.

Atlantis will carry the Atmospheric Laboratory for Applications and Science-1 (ATLAS-1), 12 instruments from the United States, France, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Japan, that will conduct 13 experiments to study the chemistry of the atmosphere, solar radiation, space plasma physics and ultraviolet astronomy.  ATLAS-1 is planned to be the first of several ATLAS flights designed to cover an entire 11-year solar cycle, the regular period of energetic activity by the sun.  Co- manifested with ATLAS-1 is the Shuttle Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet Instrument (SSBUV), which provides highly calibrated measurements of ozone to fine-tune measurements made by other NASA and NOAA satellites.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Meteosat Operational Programme (MOP-3) satellite, launched on
November 20, 1993, was the third operational geostationary Meteosat
satellite following 3 pre-operational Meteosat satellites
(Meteosat-1,-2,-3/P2).  The primary goal of the MOP satellites were
(1) to provide visible and IR day/night cloudcover data and radiances
and (2) disseminate image data to users through the Data Collection
Platform (DCP). MOP-3 (or Meteosat 6) is a 2.1 m diameter, 3.195 m
high stepped cylindrical body with solar cells on six main body
panels. The spacecraft is spin-stabilized at 100 rpm around the main
axis aligned almost parallel to the Earth's axis with spin regulated
by two small hydrazine thrusters. Spin access control and east-west
stationkeeping is provided by two pairs of large thrusters. Attitude
information is provided by Earth horizon and Sun-lit sensors. A
radiating diplole antenna directs S-band (333 kbs) transmission of DCP
image data to the Data Acquisition, Telemetry, and Tracking Station at
Odenwald, Germany for relay to the Meteosat Ground Computer System and
Meteosat Operations Control center at ESA's European Space Operations
Center (ESOC). The MOP-3 carries a single imaging radiometer in
visible/infrared wavelengths in addition to the Data Collection
Platform.

ESA's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission has been designed to observe soil moisture over the Earth's landmasses and salinity over the oceans. Soil moisture data are urgently required for hydrological studies and data on ocean salinity are vital for improving our understanding of ocean circulation patterns.
 
Launched on 2 November 2009, SMOS is the second Earth Explorer Opportunity mission to be developed as part of ESA's Living Planet Programme. As well as demonstrating the use of the new radiometer, the data acquired from this mission will contribute to furthering our knowledge of the Earth's water cycle. The data acquired from the SMOS mission will lead to better weather and extreme-event forecasting, and contribute to seasonal-climate forecasting. As a secondary objective, SMOS will also provide observations over regions of snow and ice, contributing to studies of the cryosphere.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Pioneer 10 was launched on 2 March 1972 on top of an Atlas/Centaur/TE364-4
launch vehicle. The launch marked the first use of the Atlas-Centaur as a
three-stage launch vehicle. The third stage was required to rocket Pioneer 10
to the speed of 51,810 kilometers per hour (32,400 mph) needed for the flight
to Jupiter. This made Pioneer the fastest manmade object to leave the Earth,
fast enough to pass the Moon in 11 hours and to cross the Mars orbit, about 80
million kilometers (50 million miles) away, in just 12 weeks.

On 15 July 1972 Pioneer 10 entered the Asteroid Belt, a doughnut shaped area
which measures some 280 million kilometers wide and 80 million kilometers
thick. The material in the belts travels at speed about 20 km/sec. and ranges
in size from dust particles to rock chunks as big as Alaska.

After safely traversing the Asteroid Belt, Pioneer 10 headed toward Jupiter.
Accelerated by the massive giant to a speed of 132,000 km/hr (82,000 mph),
Pioneer 10 passed by Jupiter within 130,354 km (81,000 miles) of the cloudtops
on December 3, 1973. During the passage by Jupiter, Pioneer 10 obtained the
first close-up images of the planet, charted Jupiter's intense radiation belts,
located the planet's magnetic field, and discovered that Jupiter is
predominantly a liquid planet.

Following its encounter with Jupiter, Pioneer 10 explored the outer regions of
the Solar system, studying energetic particles from the Sun (Solar Wind), and
cosmic rays entering our portion of the Milky Way. The spacecraft continued to
make valuable scientific investigations in the outer regions of the solar
system until its science mission ended on March 31, 1997. Since that time,
Pioneer 10's weak signal has been tracked by the DSN as part of an advanced
concept study of communication technology in support of NASA's future
interstellar probe mission. The spacecraft had also been used to help train
flight controllers how to acquire radio signals from space during the Lunar
Prospector mission. The power source on Pioneer 10 finally degraded to the
point where the signal to Earth dropped below the threshold for detection in
its latest contact attempt on 7 February, 2003. The previous three contacts had
very faint signals with no telemetry received. The last time a Pioneer 10
contact returned telemetry data was on 27 April 2002.

The NOAA Solar Radiation Network is a collection of stations
that provides solar radiations information, specifically, the
amount of energy a user can expect from the Sun.

History:

NOAA and its predecessor agencies, the Environmental Science
Services Administration and the Weather Bureau, have had the
Federal civilian responsibilities for monitoring and documenting
the climate of the United States, including solar radiation and
many other weather elements required by the solar energy
technology user. The solar radiation monitoring network has
existed for about 75 years with varying numbers of stations. In
the 1960's about 60 NOAA stations and 30 cooperative stations
were reporting solar radiation data to the National Climatic
Center (NCC) in Asheville, N.C. In addition, State, local, and
private organizations were making measurements with varying
degrees of regularity and quality. These non-NOAA networks
continue and, if anything, have increased in number, and with
DOE help some of their data will be archived and published by
the NCC.

Network Centers:

The current network consists of 39 stations of which 35 are in
the contiguous U.S. The remaining are in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto
Rico, and Guam. All stations are equipped to operate both a
pyranometer and pyrheliometer.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Geostationary Meteorological Satellite series are spin-stabilized satellites.  They have been developed to contribute to the improvement of Japan's meteorological services and the development of weather satellite technology.  The satellites consist of a despun section which holds the earth-oriented antennas and a 100-rpm rotating spin section which contains the Visible and Infrared Spin Scan Radiometer (VISSR), electronic devices, etc.  They have been used for the World Meteorological Organization's world Weather Watch Program which is sustained by five geostationary satellites.  The first satellite in the series was launched by a U.S. Delta rocket in July 1977.  The GMS-2,3 were launched by Japanese N-II rockets in August 1981 and 1984, and the GMS-4 was launched by Japanese H-I rocket in September. The following is a summary of the GMS series.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The RAE-1 spacecraft measured the intensity of celestial radio sources,
particularly the sun, as a function of time, direction, and frequency (0.2 to
20 MHz). The spacecraft was gravity gradient oriented. The spacecraft weight
was 193 kg, and average power consumption was 25 W. It carried two 750-ft-long
V-antennas, one facing toward the earth and one facing away from the earth. A
120-ft-long dipole antenna was oriented tangentially with respect to the
earth's surface. The spacecraft was also equipped with one 136-MHz telemetry
turnstile. The onboard experiments consisted of four step-frequency
Ryle-Vonberg radiometers operating from 0.45 to 9.18 MHz, two multichannel
total power radiometers operating from 0.2 to 5.4 MHz, one step frequency
V-antenna impedance probe operating from 0.24 to 7.86 MHz, and one dipole
antenna capacitance probe operating from 0.25 to 2.2 MHz. RAE-1 was designed
for a 1-year minimum operating lifetime. The spaecraft tape recorder
performance began to deteriorate after 2 months in orbit. In spite of several
cases of instrument malfunction, good data were obtained on all three antenna
systems. For more details, see R. R. Weber, J. K. Alexander, and R. G. Stone,
Radio Sci., v. 6, p. 1085, 1971.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Explorer 9 was the first in a series of 3.66-m inflatable spheres placed into orbit solely for the determination of atmospheric densities. The spacecraft consisted of alternating layers of aluminum foil and plastic film. Uniformly distributed over the aluminum surface were 5.1-cm dots of white paint for thermal control. Explorer 9 carried a 136-MHz beacon for tracking purposes. The beacon failed on the first orbit however, and the SAO Baker-Nunn camera network had to be relied upon for tracking. The spacecraft reentered the earth's atmosphere on April 9, 1964.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Federation of Digital Broad-Band Seismograph Networks (FDSN)
is a global organization. Its membership is comprised of groups
responsible for the installation and maintenance of broad-band
seismographs either within their geographic borders or
globally. Membership in the FDSN is open to all organizations
that operate more than one broadband station. Members agree to
coordinate station siting and provide free and open access to
their data. This cooperation helps scientists all over the world
to further the advancement of earth science and particularly the
study of global seismic activity.

The FDSN goals related to station siting and instrumentation are
to provide stations with good geographic distribution, recording
data with 24 bits of resolution in continuous time series with at
least a 20 sample per second sampling rate. The FDSN was also
instrumental in development of a universal standard for
distribution of broadband waveform data and related parametric
information. The Standard for Exchange of Earthquake DATA (SEED)
format is the result of that effort.

The Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) is a novel international co-operation in space, led by SSTL bringing together organisations from seven countries: Algeria, China, Nigeria, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom and Vietnam. The DMC Consortium is forming the first-ever microsatellite constellation bringing remarkable Earth observation capabilities both nationally to the individual satellite owners, and internationally to benefit world-wide humanitarian aid efforts.

BILSAT experiments include two payloads designed and built by SSTL's Turkish customer, TUBITAK-ODTU-BILTEN.

- The first, named COBAN, is a nine-band low resolution multi-spectral imager.
- The second, named GEZGIN, is a DSP based image processing module that uses the JPEG2000 algorithm to compress images taken by BILSAT-1's on board cameras.

Both of these payloads were designed and built by BILTEN engineers in the context of the KHTT (Know How Training and Transfer) programme that ran in parallel with the BILSAT project.

The Universe is home to numerous exotic and beautiful phenomena, some of which can generate almost inconceivable amounts of energy. Supermassive black holes, merging neutron stars, streams of hot gas moving close to the speed of light ... these are but a few of the marvels that generate gamma-ray radiation, the most energetic form of radiation, billions of times more energetic than the type of light visible to our eyes. What is happening to produce this much energy? What happens to the surrounding environment near these phenomena? How will studying these energetic objects add to our understanding of the very nature of the Universe and how it behaves?

The Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, formerly GLAST, will open this high-energy world to exploration and help us to answer these questions. With Fermi, astronomers will at long last have a superior tool to study how black holes, notorious for pulling matter in, can accelerate jets of gas outward at fantastic speeds. Physicists will be able to study subatomic particles at energies far greater than those seen in ground-based particle accelerators. And cosmologists will gain valuable information about the birth and early evolution of the Universe.

For this unique endeavor, one that brings together the astrophysics and particle physics communities, NASA is teaming up with the U.S. Department of Energy and institutions in France, Germany, Japan, Italy and Sweden. General Dynamics was chosen to build the spacecraft. Fermi was launched June 11, 2008 at 12:05 pm EDT.
Mission Objectives

 - Explore the most extreme environments in the Universe, where nature harnesses energies far beyond anything possible on Earth.
 - Search for signs of new laws of physics and what composes the mysterious Dark Matter.
 - Explain how black holes accelerate immense jets of material to nearly light speed.
 - Help crack the mysteries of the stupendously powerful explosions known as gamma-ray bursts.
 - Answer long-standing questions across a broad range of topics, including solar flares, pulsars and the origin of cosmic rays.

The NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) spacecraft lifted off aboard a United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket from Space Launch Complex 2 at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on Oct. 28, 2011 at 5:48 a.m. EDT.

The NPP spacecraft will build on more than four decades Earth observation to help us better understand our climate.

[Text and Image Source, NPOESS Preparatory Project home page, http://npp.gsfc.nasa.gov/ ]

The National Polar-Orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) Preparatory Project (NPP) is a joint mission involving the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) and the NPOESS Integrated Program Office (IPO).  

The NPP mission collects and distributes remotely-sensed land, ocean, and atmospheric data to the meteorological and global climate change communities as the responsibility for these measurements transitions from existing Earth-observing missions such as Aqua, Terra and Aura, to the NPOESS. It will provide atmospheric and sea surface temperatures, humidity sounding, land and ocean biological productivity, and cloud and aerosol properties.

For the IPO, NPP provides risk reduction with an opportunity to demonstrate and validate new instruments and processing algorithms, as well as to demonstrate and validate aspects of the NPOESS command, control, communications and ground processing capabilities prior to the launch of the first NPOESS spacecraft.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Spacecraft Brief Description
  LAGEOS  (Laser Geodetic Satellite) was a very dense (high mass-to-area
  ratio)  laser  retroreflector  satellite  which  provided  a permanent
  reference   point   in   a   very  stable  orbit  for  such  precision
  earth-dynamics  measurements  as  crustal  motions,  regional strains,
  fault motions, polar motion and earth-rotation variations, solid earth
  tides,  and  other  kinematic  and  dynamic parameters associated with
  earthquake   assessment   and   alleviation.     In  conjunction  with
  appropriate   laser-tracking   systems,   LAGEOS   permitted   extreme
  precision-ranging     measurements    for    both    geometric    mode
  (multilateration) and orbital dynamic mode determinations of positions
  of  points  on  the  earth.   It  was  the  first spacecraft dedicated
  exclusively  to  high-precision  laser  ranging and provided the first
  opportunity  to  acquire  laser-ranging data that were not degraded by
  errors  originating  in the target satellite.  The high-accuracy range
  measurements from this permanent-orbiting reference point were used to
  accomplish many extreme precision earth-dynamics measurements required
  by  the earthquake hazard assessment and alleviation objectives of the
  Earth and Ocean Physics Applications Program (EOPAP).  The performance
  in   orbit   of   LAGEOS  was  limited  only  by  degradation  of  the
  retroreflectors,  so many decades of useful life can be expected.  The
  high mass-to-area ratio and the precise, stable (attitude-independent)
  geometry  of  the  spacecraft,  together  with  the  orbit,  made this
  satellite  the  most precise position reference available.  Because it
  is  visible  in  all  parts of the world and has an extended operation
  life in orbit, LAGEOS can serve as a fundamental standard for decades.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">ERBS was part of the NASA's 3 satellite Earth Radiation Budget Experiment
(ERBE), designed to investigate how energy from the Sun is absorbed and
re-emitted by the earth. This process of absorption and re-radiation is one of
the principal drivers of the Earth's weather patterns. Observations from ERBS
are also used to determine the effects of human activities (such as burning
fossil fuels and the use CFCs) and natural occurrences (such as volcanic
eruptions) on the Earth's radiation balance. In addition to the ERBE scanning
and nonscanning instruments, the satellite also carried the Stratospheric
Aerosol Gas Experiment (SAGE II).

The ERBS was the first of three ERBE platforms which would eventually carry the
ERBE Instruments. Goddard Space Flight Center built the satellite and it was
launched by the Space Shuttle Challenger in 1984. The second ERBE Instrument
was aboard the NOAA-9 satellite when it was launched in January of 1985, and
the third was aboard the NOAA-10 satellite when it was launched in October of
1986. Although the scanning instruments on board all three ERBE satellites are
no longer operational, the nonscanning instruments are all presently
functioning.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Landsat 1, 2 and 3 operated in a circular, Sun-synchronous, near-polar orbit at
an altitude of approximately 913 km (567 miles), with a nominal 9:30 a.m.
crossing of the Equator during the descending mode.  They circled the Earth
every 103 minutes, completing 14 orbits per day and viewing the entire Earth
every 18 days.  The Landsat orbits are selected and trimmed so that each
satellite ground trace repeats its Earth coverage at the same local time every
day.  Repetitive image centers are maintained to within 37 km (23 miles). The
orbits of Landsat 4 and 5 are repetitive, circular, Sun-synchronous, and
near-polar at a nominal altitude of 705 km (438 miles) at the Equator. The
satellites cross the Equator from north-to-south on a descending orbital node
at approximately 9:45 a.m. on each pass.  Each orbit takes nearly 99 minutes,
and the spacecrafts complete just over 14 orbits each per day, covering the
entire Earth (poles excepted) every 16 days.  During processing, data obtained
is framed into individual scenes of the Earth's surface.  The ground
instantaneous field of view (IFOV) of the Landsat 1-3 MSS is 79m x 79m pixel
(resolution elements); the Landsat 4 and 5 MSS IFOV is 82m x 82m pixel. MSS
line scanning devices continually scan the Earth in a nominal 185 km swath
perpendicular to the Landsat orbital track.  The coverage patterns result in
14-percent image sidelap at the Equator for Landsat 1-3 data; Landsat 4 and 5
image side lap at the Equator is 7.3-percent. Image sidelap percentages
increase proportionally as the latitude increases.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The SMS satellite series (1 and 2) were spin-stabilized (100 rpm) and
operated in a West-to-East, geo-synchronous orbit at an altitude of
35,800 km (22,300 mi) above the equator.  These were the first and
second prototypes for the GOES satellite series.  At this altitude it
circled the axis of the Earth once in 24 hours, making its speed
synonymous with the Earth's rotation, so that the satellite remained
essentially stationary over a given geographical point. The two SMS
satellites were employed to provide overlapping coverage that centers
on the U.S. and extends over the eastern Atlantic Ocean and the
western Pacific Ocean.  The scanning system consisted of a mirror that
is stepped mechanically to provide North to South viewing, while the
rotation of the satellite provided West to East scanning.  The mirror
is stepped following each West to East scan, with each step resulting
in a change in scan angle of 192 microradians, or 7 km near nadir.  A
sequence of 1821 scans is performed to provide a 'full disk' view from
the Northern to the Southern Earth horizon.  At the rotation rate of
100 rpm, 18.21 minutes are required to complete one full North to
South view of the Earth.  The VISSR field of view provides a ground
resolution of 0.9km in the visible, and 3.0km in the infrared.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The  Combined  Release and Radiation Effects Satellite (CRRES) Program
is  comprised of several elements.  One is the release of powdered and
liquid chemicals during the first 45 to 60 days after launch, when the
spacecraft  is  in its 300-km altitude circular orbit.  These releases
are  used to study electric fields, neutral winds, and other phenomena
in  the  upper atmosphere, the ionosphere, and the magnetosphere.  The
spacecraft  spins at 20 rpm during the low altitude orbit phase of the
program.   After the chemical releases are completed, the satellite is
boosted  into  a geosynchronous-transfer-type orbit and spun down to 2
rpm.   The orbit parameters of this final orbit are as follows: apogee
altitude  -  35,800  km,  perigee altitude - 400 km, period - 630 min,
inclination  -  about  16  deg.
As  the  satellite  traverses  the  inner  magnetosphere,   a     full
complement   of   field,  particle,  and  plasma instruments  measures
the  radiation  environment.  A comprehensive set of  state-of-the-art
microelectronics  devices  and  other spacecraft components are tested
in  orbit for radiation effects.  A major segment of the CRRES payload
is  part  of  AFGL's Space Radiation Effects Program (SPACERAD).   The
SPACERAD  Program  is a comprehensive space and ground test  effort to
(a)  measure  radiation-induced  single  event  upsets and total  dose
degradation  of state-of-the-art  microelectronics  devices, including
VHSIC  and  GaAs, in a known space environment; (b) perform laboratory
radiation response and annealing  characterization  of parts identical
to  those  flown  on  CRRES;  (c)  develop algorithms to relate  space
performance   of   microelectronic   components   to    ground    test
procedures,  and  update  existing radiation ground test guidelines to
more  accurately  simulate the behavior of devices in space; (d) space
qualify  advanced  technology  devices for use in operational systems;
(e)  update  the static models of the radiation belts; and (f) develop
the first dynamic models of the high-energy particle populations.  The
on-orbit  phase  of  SPACERAD  lasts  for about 3 years.  In addition,
there  are  other  radiation belt experiments on CRRES provided by the
Navy.   The  CRRES spacecraft has the shape of an octagonal prism with
solar  arrays  on the top side.  The prism is 1 m high and 3 m between
opposite  faces.   Four of the eight compartments are for the chemical
canisters and the other four house the SPACERAD and other experiments.
The  spin axis of CRRES is controlled so that it points at the sun.

GOES 7 was launched in February 1987 and was a NASA-developed,
NOAA-operated, geosynchronous, and operational spacecraft.  The cylindrically
shaped spacecraft measured 190.5 cm in diameter and 230 cm in length, exclusive
of a magnetometer that extended an additional 83 cm beyond the cylinder shell.
The primary structural members were a honeycombed equipment shelf and thrust
tube.  The VISSR telescope was mounted on the equipment shelf and viewed the
Earth through a special aperture in the side of the spacecraft.  A support
structure extended radially out from the thrust tube and was affixed to the
solar panels, which formed the outer walls of the spacecraft and provided the
primary source of electrical power.  Located in the annulus-shaped space
between the thrust tube and the solar panels were stationkeeping and dynamics
control equipment, batteries, and most of the SEM equipment.  Proper spacecraft
attitude and spin rate (approximately 100 rpm) were maintained by two separate
sets of jet thrusters mounted around the spacecraft equator and activated by
ground command.  The spacecraft used both UHF-band and S-band frequencies in
its telemetry and command subsystem.  A low-power VHF transponder provided
telemetry and command during launch and then served as a backup for the primary
subsystem once the spacecraft attained orbit.

The spin-stabilized spacecraft carried a visible infrared spin-scan radiometer
atmospheric sounder, meteorological data collection and transmission system,
space environment monitor, energetic particle monitor, and a magnetic field
monitor.  GOES 7 was positioned at 98 degrees West in the summer (Atlantic
hurricane season) and 108 degrees West in the winter (Pacific storm season).

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Landsat 4 is the fourth satellite of the Landsat program. It was launched on
July 16th, 1982, with the primary goal of providing a global archive of
satellite photos. Although the Landsat Program is managed by NASA, data from
Landsat 4 was collected and distributed by the USGS. Landsat 4 is no longer in
operation, due to technical failure. It finally ceased transmission in 1993,
far beyond its designed life expectancy of five years. The satellite orbit
continues to be maintained by NASA.

Landsat 4 had a maximum transmission bandwidth of 85 Mbit/s, and carried an
updated Multi-Spectral Scanner used on previous Landsats, and a Thematic
Mapper. It had a maximum 30 m resolution. Shortly after launch, the satellite
lost half of its solar power, prompting fears the satellite would fail sooner
than expected. This prompted the early launch of Landsat 5, a satellite
identical in specification to Landsat 4.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">NOAA 15, also known as NOAA-K before launch, was an operational,
polar orbiting, meteorological satellite operated by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). It was the latest in the Advanced
TIROS-N (ATN) series and the design was based on the Defense
Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). Launched by the Titan II rocket
from Vandenberg AFB, NOAA-K replaced the decommissioned NOAA 12
in an afternoon equator-crossing orbit. It provided support to environmental
monitoring by complementing the NOAA/NESS geostationary
meteorological satellite program (GOES). Instruments were flown for
imaging and measurement of the Earth's atmosphere, its surface, and cloud
cover, including Earth radiation, atmospheric ozone, aerosol distribution, sea
surface temperature, vertical temperature and water profiles in the
troposphere and stratosphere; measurement of proton and electron flux at
orbit altitude, and remote platform data collection, and for SARSAT. They
included (1) an improved six-channel Advanced Very High Resolution
Radiometer/3 (AVHRR/3); (2) an improved High Resolution Infrared
Radiation Sounder (HIRS/3); (3) the Search and Rescue Satellite Aided
Tracking System (S&amp;R), which consists of the Search and Rescure
Repeater (SARR) and the Search and Rescue Processor (SARP-2); (4) the
French/CNES-provided improved ARGOS Data Collection System (DCS-2);
and (5) the Advanced Microwave Sounding Units (AMSUs), which replaced
the previous MSU and SSU instruments to become the first in the NOAA
series to support dedicated microwave measurements of temperature,
moisture, surface and hydrological studies in cloudy regions where visible
and infrared instruments have decreased capability.

ICESat (Ice, Cloud,and land Elevation Satellite) is the benchmark Earth Observing System mission for measuring ice sheet mass balance, cloud and aerosol heights, as well as land topography and vegetation characteristics. From 2003 to 2009, the ICESat mission provided multi-year elevation data needed to determine ice sheet mass balance as well as cloud property information, especially for stratospheric clouds common over polar areas. It also provided topography and vegetation data around the globe, in addition to the polar-specific coverage over the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Nimbus-5 was launched in December 1972 and was a research-and-development
satellite designed to serve as a stabilized, earth-oriented platform for
the testing of advanced meteorological sensor systems and collecting
meteorological and geological data on a global scale. The polar-orbiting
spacecraft consisted of three major structures: (1) a hollow, ring-shaped
sensor mount, (2) solar paddles, and (3) a control system housing. The solar
paddles and control system housing were connected to the sensor mount by a
truss structure, giving the satellite the appearance of an ocean buoy.
Nimbus-5 was nearly 3.7 m tall, 1.5 m in diameter at the base, and about 3 m
wide with solar paddles extended. The torus-shaped sensor mount, which formed
the satellite base, housed the electronics equipment and battery modules.  The
lower surface of the torus provided mounting space for sensors and antennas.
A box-beam structure mounted within the center of the torus provided support
for the larger sensor experiments. Mounted on the control system housing, which
was located on top of the spacecraft, were sun sensors, horizon scanners, and a
command antenna. An advanced attitude-control system permitted the spacecraft
orientation to be controlled to within plus or minus 1 degree in all three axes
(pitch, roll, and yaw).
Primary experiments included a temperature-humidity infrared radiometer (THIR)
for measuring day and night surface and cloudtop temperatures as well as the
water vapor content of the upper atmosphere, electrically scanning microwave
radiometer (ESMR) for mapping the microwave radiation from the earth's surface
and atmosphere, infrared temperature profile radiometer (ITPR) for obtaining
vertical profiles of temperature and moisture, Nimbus E microwave spectrometer
(NEMS) for determining tropospheric temperature profiles, atmospheric water
vapor abundances, and cloud liquid water contents, selective chopper radiometer
(SCR) for observing the global temperature structure of the atmosphere, and a
surface composition mapping radiometer (SCMR) for measuring the differences in
the thermal emission characteristics of the earth's surface.

NOAA-N is the latest polar-orbiting satellite developed by NASA for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). NOAA-N will collect information about Earth's atmosphere and environment to improve weather prediction and climate research across the globe.

NOAA-N is the 15th in a series of polar-orbiting satellites dating back to 1978. NOAA uses two satellites, a morning and afternoon satellite, to ensure every part of the Earth is observed at least twice every 12 hours.

Severe weather is monitored and reported to the National Weather Service which broadcasts the findings to the global community. With the early warning, effects of catastrophic weather events can be minimized.  NOAA-N also has instruments to support an international search-and-rescue program. The Search and Rescue Satellite-Aided Tracking System, called COPAS-SARSAT, transmits to ground stations the location of emergency beacons from ships, aircraft and people in distress around the world. The program, in place since 1982, has saved about 18,000 lives.

NOAA-N is the first in a series of polar-orbiting satellites to be part of a joint cooperation project with the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMESTAT).

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en"> Dropwindsondes are weather instruments that collect atmospheric
 data as they descend after being dropped from research
 aircraft.  These dropwindsondes obtain vertical profiles of
 wind, temperature, and humidity from 400mb to the surface.
 This data is then ingested by numerical numerical models to
 come up with hurricane track and intensity forecasts.  These
 observations provide grid points of observations over the
 tropical oceans which are generally devoid of weather
 observations.  Aberson and Franklin (1999) state that "accurate
 modeling of tropical cyclone motion and intensity requires both
 realistic numerical models and accurate representation of
 meteorological fields through the depth of the troposphere on a
 variety of scales."  While models have greatly improved over
 the past 20 years, significant forecast improvements are still
 possible by decreasing the analysis error.  This has been the
 primary goal of the Hurricane Research Division (HRD) branch of
 NOAA.  This is wh!  y NOAA has procured a new generation of
 dropwindsondes based on the Global Positioning System (GPS) as
 well a Gulfstream-IV jet aircraft (G-IV).  A study of the
 impact of the new dropwindsondes' observations on hurricane
 forecast models was conducted by Aberson and Frankilin in 1997.

 In the 1997 study about 30 dropwindsondes were used during each
 mission.  These observations were then put into the Geophysical
 Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) and VICBAR hurricane models
 and the Global Spectral Model (GSM) using the National Center
 for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Global Data Assimilation
 (GDAS).  GDAS uses a quality control algorithm, synthetic data
 and analysis procedures, and the Global Spectral Model in its
 data assimilation.  Further information about the data
 assimilation can be found in Aberson and Franklin (1999).

 For the study NCEP's GSM is run and is used as the boundary
 conditions for the HRD's barotropic model (VICBAR) and the GFDL
 model.  The track forecasts of the GSM, VICBAR, and GFDL models
 were compared to the CLIPER model to calculate track errors and
 the SHIFOR model to calculate intensity errors.  The CLIPER and
 SHIFOR models are statistical regression models which use only
 climatology and persistence in their forecasts.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Pioneer 11 was launched on 5 April 1973, like Pioneer 10, on top of an
Atlas/Centaur/TE364-4 launch vehicle. After safe passage through the Asteroid
belt on 19 April 1974, the Pioneer 11 thrusters were fired to add another 63.7
m/sec (210 ft/sec) to the spacecraft's velocity. This adjusted the aiming point
at Jupiter to 43,000 km (26,725 miles) above the cloudtops. The close approach
also allowed the spacecraft to be accelerated by Jupiter to a velocity 55 times
that of the muzzle velocity of a high speed rifle bullet - 173,000 km/hr
(108,000 mph) - so that it would be carried across the Solar System some 2.4
billion kilometers (1.5 billion miles) to Saturn.

During its flyby of Jupiter on 2 December 1974, Pioneer 11 obtained dramatic
images of the Great Red Spot, made the first observation of the immense polar
regions, and determined the mass of Jupiter's moon, Callisto.

Looping high above the ecliptic plane and across the Solar System, Pioneer 11
raced toward its appointment with Saturn on 1 September 1979. Pioneer 11 flew
to within 13,000 miles of Saturn and took the first close-up pictures of the
planet. Instruments located two previously undiscovered small moons and an
additional ring, charted Saturn's magnetosphere and magnetic field and found
its planet-size moon, Titan, to be too cold for life. Hurtling underneath the
ring plane, Pioneer 11 sent back amazing pictures of Saturn's rings. The rings,
which normally seem bright when observed from Earth, appeared dark in the
Pioneer pictures, and the dark gaps in the rings seen from Earth appeared as
bright rings.

Following its encounter with Saturn, Pioneer 11 explored the outer regions of
our Solar system, studying energetic particles from our Sun (Solar Wind) and
cosmic rays entering our portion of the Milky Way. In September 1995, Pioneer
11 was at a distance of 6.5 billion km (4 billion miles) from Earth. At that
distance, it takes over 6 hours for the radio signal (which is traveling at the
speed of light) to reach Earth. However, by September 1995, Pioneer 11 could no
longer make any scientific observations. On 30 September 1995, routine daily
mission operations were stopped. Intermittent contact continued until November
1995, at which time the last communication with Pioneer 11 took place. There
have been no communications with Pioneer 11 since. The Earth's motion has
carried it out of the view of the spacecraft antenna. The spacecraft cannot be
maneuvered to point back at the Earth. It is not known whether the spacecraft
is still transmitting a signal. No further tracks of Pioneer 11 are scheduled.

The Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite GOES 10 is the third satellite in a series of next generation geosynchronous spacecraft, referred to as GOES-NEXT and represented by the GOES I through GOES M spacecraft. The GOES-NEXT series is a joint effort on the part of NASA and NOAA to provide continued operational monitoring of weather systems primarily over the United States, distribute meteorological data to regional and national weather offices within the USA, contribute to the development of an environmental data collection network, contribute to the search and rescue program, improve the capability for forcasting and provide real-time warnings of solar distrubances, and to extend knowledge and understanding of atmospheric processes to improve short and long-term weather forecasts.

The GOES-NEXT series extends the capabilities of the previous GOES 1-7 spacecraft. The GOES I-M spacecraft will be placed over the equator at 135 deg West or 75 deg West. The design allows unobstructed views of the Earth for operational coverage by the spacecraft sensors. The spacecraft configuration is a compact box-shaped main body that carries the Earth-observing instruments, a continuous-drive solar array attached to the south panel through a yoke assembly, and a solar pointing instrument gimbal mounted on the solar panel yoke. The main body accomodates the sensors, electronics, and support subsystems. The communication antennas, except the Tracking, Telemetry, and Command (TT&amp;C) antenna, are hard-mounted to the Earth-facing panel. The Propulsion Module consists of the fuel and oxidizer tanks for the bipropellant propulsion subsystem mounted on the central cylinder. The Attitude and Orbit Control Substem (AOCS) provides attitude control of the spacecraft. The AOCS consists of the sensors, electronics, and the actuators. The GOES power is generated from the solar array and two 12 A-hr batteries. Power is automatically regulated during solar eclipses. A conical shaped solar sail at the end of a 58-foot boom balances torque caused by solar radiation. The main body of the spacecraft is a 2-meter cube. In its deployed orbit configuration, the overall length is about 27 meters. Initial mass was about 4640 pounds, including fuel. Design lifetime is about five years.

The Image Navigation/Registration (INR) system provides Imager and Sounder data products in real-time to users. The Communications, Command, and Data Handling subsystem is comprised of antennas, receivers, transponders, transmitters, data encoders and encryptors and multiplexers. The Tracking Telemetry and Command (TT&amp;C) subsystem provides the necessary monitor and command link between the spacecraft and the ground stations.

The GOES-NEXT instruments consist of the following: (1) Earth Imaging System, a 5-channel visible and infrared radiometer which provides Earth imagery 24 hours a day; (2) Sounding System, a 19-channel discrete-filter radiometer for obtaining atmospheric temperature and moisture soundings; (3) a Space Environment Monitor (SEM), which consists of a magnetic field sensor, a solar X-ray sensor, an energetic particle sensor (EPS), and a High Energy Proton and Alpha Detector (HEPAD); (4) a Search and Rescue subsystem (SARSAT), which receives signals from 406 MHz distress beacons and relays them to the ground; (5) a Data Collection System (DCS) for collecting and relaying real-time information from Data Collection Platforms (DCPs) such as buoys, balloons, remote weather stations, ships, and aircraft; and (6) a Weather Facsimile (WEFAX) system which relays processed weather imagary from the Wallops Island station to the user community. The SEC package has been frequently eratic during 2003.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Gemini  9, manned with two astronauts, was the seventh earth-orbiting spacecraft of the Gemini series. The blunt, cone-shaped spacecraft was 3.048  cm  in  diameter  at  the  rear  of  the craft. Primary mission objectives were to demonstrate (1) three rendezvous techniques, (2) an extravehicular  activity  (EVA) to test the astronaut maneuvering unit (AMU),  and  (3)  precision  landing capability. scientific objectives included obtaining zodiacal light and airglow horizon photographs. Two micrometeorite studies were to be carried out, and there were also one medical  and  two  technological experiments. the agena target vehicle failed  to  achieve  orbit,  and  the  agena micrometeorite experiment hardware  was  lost.  Other experiments functioned normally. The three rendezvous techniques were demonstrated, although docking could not be achieved  due  to  a failure of the augmented target-docking shroud to jettison. The EVA was curtailed due to fogging of the visor and energy expended by the astronaut. Reentry was routinely accomplished after 47 orbits on june 6, 1966, within 3.2 km of the target point.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Russian Meteor-3 series of meteorological satellites provides twice-daily weather information including data on clouds, ice and snow cover, atmospheric radiation and humidity sounding. The Meteor-3 class of satellites orbit in a higher altitude than the Meteor-2 class of satellites thus providing more complete coverage of the earth's surface. The Meteor-3 has the same payload as the Meteor-2 but also includes an advanced scanning radiometer with better spectral and spatial resolution and a spectrometer for determining total ozone content. The spacecraft incorporates three-axis stabilization (0.5 deg accuracy) and twin 10-m span solar panels. The orbit is adjusted by ion thrusters. Meteorological data is transmitted to four primary sites in the former Soviet Union in conjunction with about 80 other smaller sites. Internationally compatible Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) is made available on 137 - 138 MHz channels to ground workstations. The Meteor-3 has two 0.5 - 0.7 micron radiometers. The first provides direct relay with a swath width of 2600 km and a resolution of 1 x 2 km. The second stores data on an on-board data recorder providing global coverage with a swath width of 3100 km and a resolution of 0.7 x 1.4 km. The payload also includes a scanning IR radiometer at 10.5 - 12.5 microns with a swath width of 3100 km and resolution of 3 x 3 km and an 8-channel IR radiometer for atmospheric sounding at 9.65 - 18.7 micorns with a swath width of 2000 km and a resolution of 32 x 32 km. The Meteor-3 also includes a 4 channel UV ozone monitor (0.25 - 1.03 micron) at 2 km altitude resolution and a particle radiation detector (0.15 - 90 MeV).

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Beechcraft King Air family is part of a line of twin-turboprop aircraft produced by the Beech Aircraft Corporation (now Beechcraft Division of Hawker Beechcraft). The King Air line comprises a number of models that have been divided into two families; the Model 90 and 100 series are known as King Airs, while the Model 200 and 300 series were originally marketed as Super King Airs, with "Super" being dropped by Beechcraft in 1996 (although it is still often used to differentiate the 200 and 300 series King Airs from their smaller stablemates). As of October 2007, the only small King Air in production is the conventional-tail C90GT.

The King Air was the first aircraft in its class and has been in continuous production since 1964. It has outsold all of its turboprop competitors combined and is the only small twin-turboprop business aircraft in production. It now faces competition from jet aircraft such as the Beechcraft Premier I and Cessna Citation Mustang.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The NRL Solrad 8 satellite was one of the Solrad series that
began in 1960 to provide continuous coverage of solar radiation
with a set of standard photometers. Solrad 8 was a
spin-stabilized satellite oriented with its spin axis
perpendicular to the sun-satellite line so that the 14 solar
X-ray and ultraviolet photometers pointing radially outward from
its equatorial belt viewed the sun with each revolution. Data
were transmitted in real time by means of an FM/AM telemetry
system and were recorded by the stations on the STADAN tracking
network. The satellite performed normally except for the spin
system, which failed to maintain 60 rpm (at spin rates below 10
rpm data reduction became difficult). The spin rate gradually
decreased to 4 rpm on September 12, 1966. At that time, ground
command succeeded in reactivating spinup to 78 rpm, which
exhausted the gas supply. From this point, the spin rate
gradually decreased to 10 rpm in August 1967, when data
collection was substantially decreased.

CloudSat uses advanced radar to "slice" through clouds to see their vertical structure, providing a completely new observational capability from space. Earlier satellites could only image the uppermost layers of clouds. CloudSat is among the first satellites to study clouds on a global basis. It will look at their structure, composition and effects. This is a cooperative mission with Canada. CloudSat measurements have applications in air quality, weather models, water management, aviation safety, and disaster management.

The key observations are the vertical profiles of cloud liquid water and ice water contents and related cloud physical and radiative properties. The spacecraft payload consists of a millimeter-wave radar. CloudSat will fly in tight formation with the CALIPSO satellite carrying a backscattering lidar, and these two satellites will follow behind the Aqua satellite in a somewhat looser formation. The combination of data from the CloudSat radar with coincident measurements from CALIPSO and Aqua provides a rich source of information that can be used to assess the role of clouds in both weather and climate.
 
CloudSat was launched on 2006-04-28 from Vandenberg AFB, California

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">SMS-1 was launched in May 1974 and was a NASA-developed, NOAA-operated, prototype spacecraft for the geosynchronous series of meteorological satellites.  The cylindrically shaped spacecraft measured 190.5 cm in diameter and 230 cm in length, exclusive of a magnetometer that extended an additional 83 cm beyond the cylinder shell.  The primary structural members were a honeycombed equipment shelf and thrust tube.  The VISSR telescope was mounted on the equipment shelf and viewed the Earth through a special aperture in the side of the spacecraft.  A support structure extended radially from the thrust tube and was affixed to the solar panels, which formed the outer walls of the spacecraft and provided the primary source of electrical power.  Located in the annulus-shaped space between the thrust tube and the solar panels were stationkeeping and dynamics control equipment, batteries, and most of the SEM equipment.  Proper spacecraft attitude and spin rate (approximately 100 rpm) were maintained by two separate sets of jet thrusters mounted around the spacecraft equator and activated by ground command.  The spacecraft used both UHF-band and S-band frequencies in its telemetry and command subsystem.  A low-power VHF transponder provided telemetry and command during launch and then served as a backup for the primary subsystem once the spacecraft attained orbit. This spin-stabilized spacecraft carried a visible infrared spin-scan radiometer, meteorological data collection and relay system, space environment monitor, and a biaxial fluxgate magnetometer.  Throughout its 7 year history, it operated at 45, 75 and 92 degrees West.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Echo satellites were NASA's first experimental communications satellite project. Each spacecraft was a large metallized balloon designed to act as a passive communications reflector to bounce communication signals transmitted from one point on Earth to another. Following the failure of the launch vehicle carrying Echo 1, Echo 1A (commonly referred to as Echo 1) was successfully orbited, and was used to redirect transcontinental and intercontinental telephone, radio, and television signals. The success of Echo 1A proved that microwave transmission to and from satellites in space was understood and demonstrated the promise of communications satellites. The vehicle also provided data for the calculation of atmospheric density and solar pressure due to its large area-to-mass ratio. Echo 1A was visible to the unaided eye over most of the Earth (brighter than most stars) and was probably seen by more people than any other man-made object in space. Echo 2 continued the passive communications experiments, and also investigated the dynamics of large spacecraft and was used for global geometric geodesy. Although NASA abandonded passive communications systems in favor of active satellites following Echo 2, the Echo systems demonstrated several ground station and tracking technologies that would be used by active systems. Echo 1A reentered on May 24, 1968 followed by Echo 2 on June 7, 1969. 

Spacecraft 

1, 1A: each was a 30.5 m diameter balloon made of 0.0127 mm thick mylar polyester film. A set of 107.9-MHz beacon transmitters were carried for telemetry. The transmitters were powered by five nickel-cadmium batteries that were charged by 70 solar cells mounted on the balloon. 2: a 41.1 m diameter mylar balloon that used an improved inflation system to improve the balloon's smoothness and sphericity. Instrumentation included temperature sensors to monitor the balloon's skin temperature and pressure sensors to monitor the balloon's internal pressure. A beacon system, consisting of two transmitter assemblies, provided tracking and telemetry signals. The beacon system used solar cell panels for power and had a minimum power output of 45 mW at 136.17 MHz and 136.02 MHz.

Landsat 8 (formerly called the Landsat Data Continuity Mission, or LDCM) is NASA’s eighth satellite in the Landsat series and continues the Landsat program’s critical role in monitoring, understanding and managing the resources needed for human sustainment such as food, water and forests. As our population surpasses seven billion people, the impact of human society on the planet will increase, and Landsat monitors those impacts as well as environmental changes.

With the longest unbroken data stream of Earth’s surface as seen from space, NASA’s Earth-observing Landsat fleet has provided the world with unprecedented information on land cover changes and their residual effects since 1972. The knowledge gained from 40 years of continuous data contributes to research on climate, carbon cycle, ecosystems, water cycle, biogeochemistry and changes to Earth’s surface, as well as our understanding of visible human effects on land surfaces. Building off that research, the Landsat imaging data set has, over time, led to the improvement of human and biodiversity health, energy and water management, urban planning, disaster recovery and agriculture monitoring, all resulting in incalculable benefits to the United States and world economy.

Landsat 8 joined the Landsat 7 satellite in orbit and produces stunning pictures of Earth’s surface along with a wealth of scientific data. Landsat 8 measures Earth’s surfaces in the visible, near-infrared, short wave infrared and thermal infrared, with a moderate-resolution of 15 to 100 meters, depending on spectral frequency.

Landsat 8 is a collaboration between NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS).

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">NOAA-13 (National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration)  Weather Satellite:

Objective:

To continue the Advanced TIROS-N program by working as a
companion with NOAA-10, 11 and 12 in order to provide continuous
coverage of the Earth and to provide high-resolution global
meteorological data.

Description:

The spacecraft was launched on August 9, 1993 at Vandenberg Air
Force Base, California on board the Atlas E.

The spacecraft was rectangularly shaped (166" long by 74" high)
and powered by a 191" by 94" solar array. The satellite was
Earth oriented, three-axis stabilized and weighed approximately
2200 pounds.  NOAA-13 was the sixth operational satellite in the
Advanced TIROS-N series. The satellite carried the AVHRR, TOVS,
and the solar proton monitor. All of which were present on
previous NOAA satellites. The ERBE instruments, the SBUV
radiometer and the SARSAT systems were also flown on this
satellite.

NOAA-13 was placed in a near circular, (470nm) polar orbit. The
spacecraft and its systems operated successfully for 12 days
until a circuit failure resulted in a power loss aboard the
craft. At this time the spacecraft is still in its polar orbit;
however, no data is being received.

DMSP 5D-1/F4 was one of a series of meteorological satellites developed and operated by the Air Force under the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). This program, previously known as DAAP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objectives of this program are to provide global visual and infrared cloud-cover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense requirements. Operationally, the program consisted of two satellites in planned 830-km sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other at local noon. The 5.4-m long spacecraft was separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform (PMP) for sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment, (2) an equipment support module (ESM) containing the electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors, (3) a reaction control equipment (RCE) support structure (including the third-stage motor, hydrazine reaction control system) that supported (4) a 9.29 sq m solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization was controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system, so that sensors were maintained in the desired 'earth-looking' mode. One feature was the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allowed automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element. The operational line scan system (OLS) built by Westinghouse, was the primary data acquisition system that provided real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night visual and infrared imagery at 1/3 nautical mile resolution for all major land masses, 1-1/2 nautical mile resolution for complete global coverage, and provided with this data calibration, timing, and other auxiliary signals to the spacecraft for digital transmission to the ground. A supplementary sensor package, the special sensor H (SSH), a step-scanning radiometer, was the infrared temperature-humidity-ozone sounder. The data processing system, which included three high-density tape recorders, was capable of storing a total of 400 min of data, each allowing full global coverage twice daily. Either recorded or real-time data were transmitted to ground-receiving sites by two redundant S-band transmitters. Recorded data were read out to tracking sites located at Fairchild AFB, WA, and Loring AFB, ME, and relayed by SATCOM to Air Fource Global Weather Central, Offutt AFB, NE. Real-time data were read out at mobile tactical sites located around the world. A more complete description of the satellite can be found in the report `The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program,' D.A. Nichols, Optical Engineering, 14, 4, July - August 1975.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The GEOTAIL mission is a collaborative project undertaken by the Institute of
Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) and the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA). Its primary objective is to study the dynamics of the
Earth's magnetotail over a wide range of distance, extending from the
near-Earth region (8 Earth radii (Re) from the Earth) to the distant tail
(about 200 Re). The GEOTAIL spacecraft was designed and built by ISAS and was
launched on July 24, 1992.

The Geotail mission measures global energy flow and transformation in the
magnetotail to increase understanding of fundamental magnetospheric processes.
This will include the physics of the magnetopause, the plasma sheet, and
reconnection and neutral line formation (i.e., the mechanisms of input,
transport, storage, release and conversion of energy in the magnetotail).
Geotail, together with Wind, Polar, SOHO, and Cluster projects, constitute a
cooperative scientific satellite project designated the International
Solar-Terrestrial Physics (ISTP) program which aims at gaining improved
understanding of the physics of solar terrestrial relations.

Geotail is a spin-stabilized spacecraft utilizing mechanically despun antennas
with a design lifetime of about four years. The nominal spin rate of the
spacecraft is about 20 rpm around a spin axis maintained between 85 and 89 deg
to the ecliptic plane. Geotail is cylindrical, approximately 2.2 m in diameter
and 1.6 m high with body-mounted solar cells. Geotail also has a two-hour
back-up battery subsystem which operates when the spacecraft is in the Earth's
shadow.

Real-time telemetry data transmitted in the X-band are received at the Usuda
Deep Space Center (UDSC) in Japan. There are two tape recorders on board, each
with a capacity of 450 Mbit which allow daily 24-hour data coverage. The data
are collected in playback mode by the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN).

The Geotail mission is divided into two phases. During the two-year initial
phase, the orbit apogee was kept on the nightside of the Earth by using the
Moon's gravity in a series of double-lunar swing-by maneuvers that result in
the spacecraft spending most of its time in the distant magnetotail (maximum
apogee about 200 Earth radii) with a period varying from one to four months.
Then, starting in November 1994, there were a series of maneuvers to bring the
spacecraft into its near-Earth orbit. This transition orbit lasted about three
months with the apogee varying from 50 RE to 30 RE. The second phase is
dedicated to the study of near-Earth magnetospheric processes, including
neutral line formation.

The GEOTAIL mission consists of the following experiments:
- Comprehensive Plasma Investigation (CPI)
- Electric Fields Detector (EFD)
- Energetic Particle and Ion Composition (EPIC)
- High-Energy Particles (HEP)
- Low-Energy Particles (LEP)
- Magnetic Field Experiment
- Plasma Waves Investigation (PWI)

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">EROS-A (of Ofeq-3 heritage) is a high-resolution commercial imaging satellite of ImageSat International N.V. headquartered at Limassol, Cyprus, and designed and built by Israeli Aircraft Industries Ltd. (IAI). The overall objective is to launch and operate a constellation of high-resolution commercial satellites, primarily for intelligence and national security applications and to serve a global customer base. The spaceborne remote sensing technology for the EROS family was approved by the government of Israel in Oct. 1996. 

The EROS program offers a combination of services and products tailored to meet specific customer requirements and budgets: 

• The option to acquire exclusive imaging rights over a defined footprint or the ability to acquire imagery on an exclusive basis.

• Rapid delivery of imagery to the customer, either through direct downlink, electronic transfer or courier.

• Provision of low-cost imagery products to support applications in many fields.

Spacecraft:

The EROS-A satellite structure consists of low-mass composite material with passive thermal control, it is three-axis stabilized. Attitude control and navigation is performed using horizon sensors, sun sensors, gyros and magnetometer, four reaction wheels and thrusters. The pointing accuracy is &lt;0.1º in all three axes, attitude stabilization is &lt; 40 µrad/s, the jitter is &lt; 0.2 µrad. S/C mass = 260 kg (178 kg S/C bus, 42 kg of instrument mass and 30 kg of hydrazine), solar panel power (silicon array, fixed panels) = 450 W (EOL), plus 14 Ah NiCd batteries for eclipse operation, the bus power consumption at imaging session is 300 W. S/C design life = 4 years, however the estimated operational life of the satellite is ten years. 

RF communications: Imagery is transmitted in X-band at a rate of 70 Mbit/s (RF downlink) to the ground receiving stations, using a 1.5 W transmitter and one of the two existing two-axis gimbaled directional antennas. The EROS satellites are monitored/operated in S-Band (TT&amp;C) via a single ground control station (GCS), located at IAI/MBT in Israel (3 to 4 passes per day and per satellite are in station visibility). The S-band data rate is either 2.5 or 15 kbit/s selectable by the GCS.

ImageSat has a global network of ground segment infrastructure, for real-time image data acquisition. This network is comprised of the ImageSat Central Ground Control Station, a network of EROS-compatible Ground Receiving Stations on 5 continents and EROS-compatible Ground Control Stations based at exclusive customers' premises (see SOP Program).

The EROS A satellite has limited availability of onboard source data storage, as the satellite was designed to cater to customers acquiring real-time, exclusive imaging and download rights over a defined geographic footprint, in view of their own EROS-compatible GRS (Ground Receiving Stations).

Operational capabilities/services primarily include:

• Satellite Operating Partner (SOP) Program. This service provides a dedicated regional satellite with local customer tasking. SOP receiving ground stations are able to plan, to generate and to transmit imaging commands to the satellite and to download imagery in real-time.

• PAS (Priority Acquisition Service) Program. The service provides highest priority tasking of the EROS satellite, in areas not previously acquired by SOP Customers.

• Non-exclusive acquisitions. ImageSat sells EROS imagery on a non-exclusive basis to customers for civilian applications, such as mapping, disaster planning and monitoring, environmental management, homeland security and border control, and a range of development-related projects. 

aunch: EROS-A was launched on a Russian Start-1 launcher on Dec. 5, 2000 from the Svobodny Cosmodrome in eastern Siberia.

Orbit for EROS-A: Circular sun-synchronous orbit, altitude 480 km, inclination = 97.3º, period = 94.7 minutes, local time of descending node at 10:00 hours. The revisit capability at at latitude of 10º within a 15º cone is within 10.5 days. A revisit period/satellite at latitude of 10º is 4.5 days within a 30º cone, and only 2.5 days within a 45º cone.

Operational status of mission: The EROS-A spacecraft and all subsystems are operating nominally as of 2008. Operations are expected to last until 2010. 

Background on EROS program:

EROS is a program of ImageSat International, N.V., formerly WIS (West Indian Space) Ltd., Cayman Islands. The name change took place in June 2000. ImageSat was re-incorporated in Curacao, Netherlands Antilles. ImageSat's ownership includes: Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) of Tel-Aviv (owned by the Israeli government), Elbit Systems Ltd. of Haifa, and private investors from Europe and the United States.

• EROS-B was launched on April 25, 2006 on a Start-1 launch vehicle from the Svobodny Cosmodrome in eastern Siberia

• A third satellite, EROS C, will offer comparable panchromatic resolution to EROS B, as well as multispectral resolution of 2.8 m GSD; it is planned for launch in 2009.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG) is a community-based project to conduct a detailed study of solar internal structure and dynamics using helioseismology. In order to exploit this new technique, GONG has developed a six-station network of extremely sensitive, and stable velocity imagers located around the Earth to obtain nearly continuous observations of the SUN's "five-minute" oscillations, or pulsations.

The site comprising the GONG Network are:
Big Bear, California
Cerro Tololo, Chile
Learmonth, Australia
Mauna Loa, Hawaii
Udaipur, India
Observatorio del Teide, Canary Islands

The five-minute oscillation is a subtle effect. Individual modes may exhibit velocities of less than 0.2 meters/second, while the sum of all of the modes is only a few hundred meters/second. The ultimate intention is to have the measurements be limited by the Sun's ``random'' surface motions. This means developing six stable instruments capable of making imaged velocity measurements with a precision of significantly less than one meter/second - one part in ten million! A low technological risk instrument based on a Michelson interferometer was selected, and it will be supported by a highly automated, portable installation, somewhat reminiscent of a spacecraft experiment.

Each station in the network will produce more than 200 megabytes of data every day. Over the three year observing run, the raw data will exceed one terabyte, and the various processed data sets will exceed this several-fold. To keep up with the data flow, a pipe-line capable of roughly 6 Megaflops has be established to do the bulk processing and provide subsets of the data for the scientific community. Because of the widespread scientific participation, distributed data, software and analysis tools will be provided. Thus, in addition to a central facility, participating scientists will have access to readily transportable data archives and software, as well as shared analysis programs at their home institutions.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The IRS-P3 satellite was launched from Sriharikota, India, using Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle – PLSV-D3. IRS-P3 was put in a polar, sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of 817km with equatorial crossing time of 10:30 A.M in the descending node.

IRS - P3 has an X-ray astronomy and two remote sensing payloads, namely Wide Field Sensor (WiFS) and Modular Optoelectronics Scanner (MOS). The mission caters to oceanography applications.

IRS - P3 WiFS is similar to IRS - 1C WiFS but for the inclusion of an additional band in the Middle Infra-red (MIR) region. This sensor is primarily meant for vegetation dynamic studies while MOS is meant for ocean related studies. MOS has helped the ocean application scientists in developing necessary algorithms for extracting ocean parameters such as phytoplankton, yellow substance and suspended sediments in ocean waters.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Cessna 205, 206, and 207, known variously as the Super Skywagon, Stationair, and Super Skylane are a family of single engine, general aviation aircraft with fixed landing gear used in commercial air service and also for personal use. The family was originally developed from the popular retractable-gear Cessna 210.

The line's combination of a powerful engine, rugged construction and a large cabin has made these aircraft popular bush planes. Cessna describes the 206 as "the sport-utility vehicle of the air." These airplanes are also used for aerial photography, skydiving and other utility purposes. They can also be equipped with floats, amphibious floats and skis. Alternatively, they can be fitted with luxury appointments for use as a personal air transport.

Between the start of production in 1962 and 2006 the total Cessna 205, 206 and 207 production has been 8509 aircraft so far.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Endeavour, the newest addition to the four-orbiter fleet, is named after the first ship commanded by James Cook, the 18th century British explorer, navigator and astronomer. For the first time, a national competition involving students in elementary and secondary schools produced the name of the new orbiter; it was announced by President George Bush in 1989. The Space Shuttle orbiter Endeavour was delivered to Kennedy Space Center in May 1991, and flew its first mission, highlighted by the dramatic rescue of a stranded communications satellite, a year later in May 1992.

Endeavour features new hardware designed to improve and expand orbiter capabilities. Most of this equipment was later incorporated into the other three orbiters during out-of-service major inspection and modification programs. Endeavour's upgrades include:

-A 40-foot diameter drag chute that is expected to reduce the orbiter's rollout distance by 1,000 to 2,000 feet.

-The plumbing and electrical connections needed for Extended Duration Orbiter (EDO) modifications to allow up to 28-day missions.

-Updated avionics systems that include advanced general purpose computers, improved inertial measurement units and tactical air navigation systems, enhanced master events controllers and multiplexer-demultiplexers, a solid-state star tracker and improved nose wheel steering mechanisms.

-An improved version of the Auxiliary Power Units (APU's) that provide power to operate the Shuttle's hydraulic systems.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
NOAA-4 was launched in November 1974 and was one in a series of
reconfigured ITOS satellites launched with new meteorological sensors
onboard to expand the operational capability of the ITOS system.  The
primary objective was to provide global daytime and nighttime direct
readout real-time cloudcover data on a daily basis. The
sun-synchronous spacecraft was also capable of supplying global
atmospheric temperature soundings and very high resolution infrared
cloudcover data for selected areas in either a direct readout or a
tape-recorder mode. A secondary objective was to obtain global
solar-proton flux data on a real-time daily basis. The sensors were
mounted on the satellite baseplate with their optical axes directed
vertically earthward. The nearly cubical spacecraft measured 1 by 1 by
1.2 m. The satellite was equipped with three curved solar panels that
were folded during launch and deployed after orbit was achieved. Each
panel measured over 4.2 m in length when unfolded and was covered with
approximately 3500 solar cells measuring 2 by 2 cm. The dynamics and
attitude control system maintained desired spacecraft orientation
through gyroscopic principles incorporated into the satellite
design. Earth orientation of the satellite body was maintained by
taking advantage of the precession induced from a momentum flywheel so
that the satellite body precession rate of one revolution per orbit
provided the desired 'earth-looking' attitude. Minor adjustments in
attitude and orientation were made by means of magnetic coils and by
varying the speed of the momentum flywheel.
The primary sensors consisted of a Very High Resolution Radiometer
(VHRR), Vertical Temperature Profile Radiometer (VTPR), and a Scanning
Radiometer (SR).

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Nimbus-2 was launched in May 1966 and was the second in a series of
second-generation meteorological research-and-development satellites that was
designed to serve as a stabilized, earth-oriented platform for the testing of
advanced meteorological sensor systems and for collecting meteorological data.
The polar-orbiting spacecraft consisted of three major elements: (1) a sensory
ring, (2) solar paddles, and (3) the control system housing. The solar paddles
and the control system housing were connected to the sensory ring by a truss
structure, giving the satellite the appearance of an ocean buoy. Nimbus-2 was
nearly 3.7 m tall, 1.5 m in diameter at the base, and about 3 m across with
solar paddles extended. The sensory ring, which formed the satellite base,
housed the electronics equipment and battery modules. The lower surface of the
torus-shaped sensory ring provided mounting space for sensors and telemetry
antennas. An H-frame structure mounted within the center of the torus provided
support for the larger experiments and tape recorders. Mounted on the control
system housing, which was located on top of the spacecraft, were sun sensors,
horizon scanners, gas nozzles for attitude control, and a command antenna. Use
of a stabilization and control system permitted the spacecraft's orientation to
be controlled to within plus or minus 1 degree for all three axes (pitch, roll,
and yaw).
The spacecraft carried an advanced vidicon camera system for recording and
storing remote cloudcover pictures, an automatic picture transmission camera
for providing real-time cloudcover pictures, and both high- and
medium-resolution infrared radiometers (HRIR and MRIR) for measuring the
intensity and distribution of electromagnetic radiation emitted by and
reflected from the earth and its atmosphere. The spacecraft and experiments
performed normally after launch until July 26, 1966, when the spacecraft tape
recorder failed. Its function was taken over by the HRIR tape recorder until
November 15, 1966, when it also failed. Some real-time data were collected
until January 17, 1969, when the spacecraft mission was terminated owing to
deterioration of the horizon scanner used for earth reference.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (HESSI) mission consists of a single
spin-stabilized spacecraft in a low-altitude orbit inclined 38 degrees to the
Earth's equator. The only instrument on board is an imaging spectrometer with
the ability to obtain high fidelity color movies of solar flares in X rays and
gamma rays. It uses two new complementary technologies: fine grids to modulate
the solar radiation, and germanium detectors to measure the energy of each
photon very precisely. The HESSI was renamed the Reuven Ramaty High Energy
Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). RHESSI is a NASA Small Explorer satellite
and was launched February 5, 2002.

RHESSI's imaging capability is achieved with fine tungsten and/or molybdenum
grids that modulate the solar X-ray flux as the spacecraft rotates at ~ 15 rpm.
Up to 20 detailed images can be obtained per second. This is sufficient to
track the electrons as they travel from their acceleration site, believed to be
in the solar corona, and slow down on their way to the lower solar atmosphere.

The high-resolution spectroscopy is achieved with 9 cooled germanium crystals
that detect the X-ray and gamma-ray photons transmitted through the grids over
the broad energy range of 3 keV to 20 MeV. Their fine energy resolution of
about 1 keV is more than sufficient to reveal the detailed features of the
X-ray and gamma-ray spectra, clues to the nature of the electron and ion
acceleration processes.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">AlSAT-1 is part of an international (BNSC-UK, China, Nigeria and Thailand) disaster-monitoring constellation (DMC) of 6 micro-satellites dedicated for monitoring disasters throughout the earth, such as floods, fires, earthquakes, volcanoes, large-scale industrial accidents and civil strife. When there are no disasters, AlSAT-1 will be used for Algerian purposes such as monitoring desertification, industrial and marine pollution, agricultural monitoring, geophysics mapping and fire detection. The nature of the mission is that the 6 micro-satellites, when coordinated together, can produce a daily revisit with a 32 m resolution multi-spectral imaging and 600 km ground track. AlSAT-1 uses the flight proven modular SSTL bus from previous missions but will carry a push broom imager for the first time on SSTL micro-satellites. As a part of the constellation and to maintain a daily coverage, AlSAT-1 is equipped with a propulsion system for orbit corrections.

AlSAT-1's main payload a multi-spectral earth observation imager. Digital store and forward communications can be experienced between two points and autonomous GPS positioning techniques also accomplished.

The Algerian satellite is one of SSTLs new generation microsatellites in a sense that it carries a new type of push broom sensors. These types of sensors can previously only be found in larger commercial satellites. Because of the advance in electronics and semiconductor integration on a single chip, nowadays these sensors are being implemented by SSTL on microsatellites.

AlSAT-1 is designed to view the earth surface with a 32 m resolution in three spectral bands (R, G, NIR) and a ground track of 600 km. The spectral bands were chosen to correspond to those used by commercial satellites in the following wavelengths (in micrometer) 0.5-0.6 micrometer, 0.6-0.7 , 0.7-0.8 ). The imaging system comprises two cameras for each spectral band and two sensors with 10 000 pixels each. This represents a huge quantity of data for the electronics on board (processors, SSDR, fast clocks) to deal with.

The cameras provide 32 m ground resolution in 3 spectral bands capable of giving detailed information on earth resources, land use and effects of pollution and natural disasters using 2x10 000 pixels linear array detectors digitized to 8 bits radiometric resolution (256 levels). The image swath width is 600 km and the imager can collect images continuously along the flight track. The images are stored on board the microsatellite via the On Board Computer (OBC) and Controller Area Network (CAN) in the 2x512 Mbytes Solid State Data Recorder (SSDR) for later transmission to ground via digital packet error controlled links at 8 Mbit/s in S-band.

However, on the satellite there will be an option to do windowing. By using this technique, we can take images of 100x100 km and thus extend the track range.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Mission Overview
 
The joint U.S./Argentinian Aquarius/Satélite de Aplicaciones Científicas (SAC)-D mission will map the salinity—the concentration of dissolved salt—at the ocean surface, information critical to improving our understanding of two major components of Earth's climate system: the water cycle and ocean circulation. By measuring ocean salinity from space, Aquarius will provide new insights into how the massive natural exchange of freshwater between the ocean, atmosphere and sea ice influences ocean circulation, weather and climate.

Because ocean surface salinity varies from place to place and over time, scientists can use it to trace the ocean's role in Earth's water cycle. For example, more than 85 percent of global evaporation and more than 75 percent of global precipitation occur over the ocean. By measuring changes in ocean surface salinity caused by these processes, as well as by ice melting and river runoff, Aquarius/SAC-D will provide important new information about how Earth's freshwater moves between the ocean and atmosphere and around the globe.

Knowing ocean surface salinity can also help scientists track ocean currents and better understand ocean circulation. Salinity, together with temperature, determines how dense and buoyant seawater is. This, in turn, drives how ocean waters are layered and mixed and the formation of water masses. Salinity also has a major effect on ocean circulation, including the flow of currents that move heat from the tropics to the poles.

Aquarius/SAC-D will provide essential ocean surface salinity data needed to link the water cycle and ocean circulation—two major components of the climate system. This information, in turn, will help scientists improve the accuracy of computer climate models.

Global ocean salinity has been an area of much scientific uncertainty. Past measurements of salinity have been limited mostly to summertime observations in shipping lanes. Recently, a European mission has begun making ocean surface salinity measurements. With the launch of Aquarius/SAC-D, scientists will collect more data in the mission's first few months than had been amassed by ships and in-water sensors during the previous 125 years.

Scheduled for launch no earlier than June 2011, Aquarius/SAC-D is designed to measure ocean surface salinity for at least three years, repeating its global pattern every seven days. During its lifetime, the mission will provide monthly maps of global changes in ocean surface salinity with a resolution of 150 kilometers (93 miles), showing how salinity changes from month-to-month, season-to-season and year-to-year. The spacecraft will fly in a sun-synchronous orbit 657 kilometers (408 miles) above Earth's surface.

NASA's Aquarius is the primary instrument on the SAC-D spacecraft. It consists of three passive microwave radiometers to detect the surface emission that is used to obtain salinity and an active scatterometer to measure the ocean waves that affect the precision of the salinity measurement. While salinity levels in the open ocean generally range from 32 to 37 practical salinity units, or psu (roughly equivalent to parts per thousand), the Aquarius sensor will be able to detect changes in salinity as small as 0.2 psu. This is equivalent to about a "pinch" (i.e., 1/8 of a teaspoon) of salt in one gallon of water.

Aquarius/SAC-D is a collaboration between NASA and Argentina's space agency, Comision Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE), with participation from Brazil, Canada, France and Italy. The Aquarius instrument was jointly built by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., and NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md. JPL will manage Aquarius through the mission's commissioning phase and will archive mission data. Goddard will manage the mission's operations phase and process Aquarius science data. NASA's Launch Services Program at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida is managing the launch. CONAE is providing the SAC-D spacecraft, an optical camera, a thermal camera in collaboration with Canada, a microwave radiometer, sensors developed by various Argentine institutions, and the mission operations center in Argentina. France and Italy are also contributing instruments.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Buoys, in the oceanographic context, are platforms whose defining characteristic is that they float at a predetermined depth in the ocean.  Most often BUOYS float on the surface of the ocean.  Typically, BUOYS are divided into two categories: drifting and moored buoys.  

Moored BUOYS are floats fixed in water to mark a location, warn of
danger, or indicate a navigational channel. They can also take
scientific measurements of the water including temperature and
water quality measurements.

Drifting BUOYS are exclusively scientific platforms that drift along the surface of the ocean following the ocean currents and/or the surface winds depending on their configuration.  Along the trajectory, they collect oceanographic or meteorological data.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">SSTL developed the NigeriaSat-1 enhanced microsatellite during a know-how and technology transfer program for the Federal Ministry of Science and Technology (FMST) of Nigeria. NigeriaSat-1 is the first step in FMSTs plan to develop Nigerias national space infrastructure. The NigeriaSat-1 programme included the satellite, a mission control station in Abuja, Nigeria and hands-on training at Surrey for a team of Nigerian engineers. During the project, Nigeria formed a National Space Research and Development Agency (NASRDA), which now manages the NigeriaSat-1 program.
                
NigeriaSat-1 is a satellite of the standard Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) design. It carries an optical imaging payload developed by SSTL to provide 32-m ground resolution with an exceptionally wide swath width of over 640 km. The payload uses green, red and near infrared bands equivalent to Landsat TM+ bands 2, 3 and 4. Images are stored in a 1-gigabyte solid-state data recorder and returned via an 8-Mbps S-band downlink.

NigeriaSat-1 can image scenes as large as 640 x 560 km, providing unparalleled wide-area, medium-resolution data. The data will be used within Nigeria to monitor pollution, land use and other medium-scale phenomena. .
                
In addition, NASRDA have joined the Disaster Monitoring Constellation (DMC) Consortium, and images from NigeriaSat-1 will be available to disaster relief agencies world-wide through the DMC data sharing system.

NigeriaSat-1 was launched in September 2003 from Pletsesk on a Kosmos launch vehicle, one of three satellites simultaneously launched to complete the first phase of the Disaster Monitoring Constellation, to provide medium-resolution imagery with daily worldwide revisit.

The objective is to provide a daily global imaging capability at medium resolution (30-40 m), in 3-4 spectral bands, for rapid-response disaster monitoring and mitigation.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">TIROS-7 Objectives:

Continue research and development of the meteorological
satellite information system; obtain improved data for use in
weather forecasting, especially during hurricane season.

Description:

The spacecraft was 42 inches in diameter, 19 inches high and
weighed 270 pounds. The craft was made of aluminum alloy and
stainless steel then covered by 9200 solar cells. The solar
cells served to charge the nickel-cadmium (nicad)
batteries. Three pairs of solid-propellant spin rockets were
mounted on the base plate.

TIROS-7 was also designed to make infrared measurements of
reflected solar and terrestrial radiation over selected spectrum
ranges and gather data on electron density and temperature in
space. To accomplish this new expanded mission, TIROS-7 carried
two wide-angle camera systems, a magnetic tape recorder, and
infrared experimentation equipment. The electron density and
temperature probes were the same as the ones flown on board
Explorer 17.

The spacecraft operating system still included the infrared
horizon scanner, the north direction indicator, despin weights
and spinup rockets, and the magnetic attitude control
system. TIROS-7 was deactivated after furnishing over 30,000
cloud photographs; it lasted the longest of the TIROS series
thus far, 1809 days.

Experiments on Tiros-7:
Low-Resolution Omnidirectional Radiometer
Scanning Radiometer
Langmuir Probe
Television Camera System

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">GOES 8 (GOES-I) was launched on April 13, 1994. On Tuesday April 1,
2003 GOES-12 (Formerly Referred to as GOES-M) replaced GOES-8 as the
operational GOES East Satellite. NOAA deactivated the satellite on May
5, 2004 and will boost it into an orbit 350 kilometers above its
original geostationary position, where it will be disposed safely in
three controlled burns.

GOES I-M represented the next generation of meteorological satellites
and introduces two new features.  The first feature, flexible scan,
offers small-scale area imaging that lets meteorologists take pictures
of local weather trouble spots. This allows them to improve short-term
forecasts over local areas. The second feature, simultaneous and
independent imaging and sounding, is designed to allow weather
forecasters to use multiple measurements of weather phenomena to
increase the accuracy of their forecasts.

Each satellite in the series carries two major instruments: an Imager
and a Sounder. These instruments acquire high resolution visible and
infrared data, as well as temperature and moisture profiles of the
atmosphere. They continuously transmit these data to ground terminals
where the data are processed for rebroadcast to primary weather
services both in the United States and around the world, including the
global research community.

The GOES I-M mission ran from the mid-1990s into the
first decade of the 21st century.  Each element of the mission has
been designed to meet all in-orbit performance requirements for at
least five years.

The GOES I-M system performed the following basic functions:
+ Acquisition, processing, and dissemination of imaging and
sounding data.
+ Acquisition and dissemination of Space Environment Monitor
(SEM) data.
+ Reception and relay of data from ground-based Data Collection
Platforms (DCPs) that are situated in carefully selected urban and
remote areas to the NOAA Command and Data Acquisition (CDA) station.
+ Continuous relay of Weather Facsimile (WEFAX) and other data to
users, independent of all other functions.
+ Relay of distress signals from people, aircraft, or marine vessels
to the search and rescue ground stations of the Search and Rescue
Satellite Aided Tracking (SARSAT) system.
GOES provides the instantaneous relay functions for the SARSAT system.
A dedicated search and rescue transponder on board GOES is designed to
detect emergency distress signals originating from Earth-based
sources. These unique identification signals are normally combined
with signals received by a low-Earth orbiting satellite system and
relayed to a search and rescue ground terminal. The combined data are
used to perform effective search and rescue operations.
The GOES I-M system serves a region covering the central and eastern
Pacific Ocean; North, Central, and South America; and the central and
western Atlantic Ocean. Pacific coverage includes Hawaii and the Gulf
of Alaska. This is accomplished by two satellites, GOES West located
at 135 west longitude and GOES East at 75 west longitude. A common
ground station, the CDA station located at Wallops, Virginia,
supports the interface to both satellites. The NOAA Satellite
Operations Control Center (SOCC), in Suitland, Maryland, provides
spacecraft scheduling, health and safety monitoring, and engineering
analyses.

Delivery of products involves ground processing of the raw instrument
data for radiometric calibration and Earth location information, and
retransmission to the satellite for relay to the data user community.
The processed data are received at the control center and disseminated
to the National Weather Service's (NWS) National Meteorological
Center, Camp Springs, Maryland, and NWS forecast offices, including
the National Hurricane Center, Miami, Florida, and the National Severe
Storms Forecast Center, Kansas City, Missouri. Processed data are also
received by Department of Defense installations, universities, and
numerous private commercial users.

GOES-I/M IMAGER
The GOES Imager is a multi-channel instrument designed to sense
radiant and solar-reflected energy from sampled areas of the
Earth. The multi-element spectral channels simultaneously sweep
east-west and west-east along a north-to-south path by means of a
two-axis mirror scan system. The instrument can produce full-Earth
disc images, sector images that contain the edges of the Earth, and
various sizes of area scans completely enclosed within the Earth scene
using a new flexible scan system. Scan selection permits rapid
continuous viewing of local areas for monitoring of mesoscale
(regional) phenomena and accurate wind determination.

GOES-I/M SOUNDER
The GOES Sounder is a 19-channel discrete-filter radiometer covering
the spectral range from the visible channel wavelengths to 15
microns. It is designed to provide data from which atmospheric
temperature and moisture profiles, surface and cloud-top temperatures,
and ozone distribution can be deduced by mathematical analysis. It
operates independently of and simultaneously with the Imager, using a
similarly flexible scan system. The Sounder's multi-element detector
array assemblies simultaneously sample four separate fields or
atmospheric columns. A rotating filter wheel, which brings spectral
filters into the optical path of the detector array, provides the
infrared channel definition.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The LAGEOS satellites are passive vehicles covered with
retroreflectors designed to reflect laser beams transmitted from
ground stations. By measuring the time between transmission of
the beam and reception of the reflected signal from the
satellite, stations can precisely measure the distance between
themselves and the satellite. These distances can be used to
calculate station positions to within 1-3 cm. Long term data
sets can be used to monitor the motion of the Earth's tectonic
plates, measure the Earth's gravitational field, measure the
"wobble" in the Earth's axis of rotation, and better determine
the length of an Earth day.

LAGEOS 2 was a joint program between NASA and the Italian space
agency (ASI), which built the satellite using LAGEOS 1 drawings
and specifications, handling fixtures, and other materials
provided by NASA.

LAGEOS 2's orbit was selected to provide more coverage of
  seismically active areas, such as the Mediterranean Basin and
  California, and may help scientists understand irregularities
  noted in the motion of LAGEOS 1. Ground tracking stations are
  located in many countries (including the US, Mexico, France,
  Germany, Poland, Australia, Egypt, China, Peru, Italy, and
  Japan) and data from these stations is available world-wide to
  investigators studying crustal dynamics. LAGEOS 1 also
  contains a message plaque addressed to human and other beings
  of the far distant future with maps of the Earth from 3
  different eras - 268 million years in the past, present day,
  and 8 million years in the future (the satellite's estimated
  decay date). Spacecraft: Both satellites are spherical bodies
  with an aluminum shell wrapped around a brass core. The design
  was a compromise between numerous factors including the need
  to be as heavy as possible to minimise the effects of
  non-gravitational forces vs.  being light enough to be placed
  in a high orbit and the need to accommodate as many
  retroreflectors as possible vs. the need to minimise surface
  area to minimise the effects of solar pressure. The materials
  were chosen to reduce the effects of the Earth's magnetic
  field on the satellite's orbit.426 cube-corner retroreflectors
  are imbedded in the satellites' surface.422 of these are made
  of fused silica glass while the other 4 are made of
  germanium. The vehicles have no onboard sensors or
  electronics, and are not attitude controlled. Payload: Science
  is performed by reflecting laser light from the vehicle's 426
  retroreflectors.

 Additional characteristics:

-50 years design life
-0.6m total length
-0.6m maximum diameter
-405 kg total mass

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Orbiting Geophysical Observatory 6 (OGO 6) was a large observatory
instrumented with 26 experiments designed to study the various
interrelationships between, and latitudinal distributions of, high-altitude
atmospheric parameters during a period of increased solar activity. The main
body of the spacecraft was attitude controlled by means of horizon scanners and
gas jets so that its orientation was maintained constant with respect to the
earth and the sun. The solar panels rotated on a horizontal axis extending
transversely through the main body of the spacecraft. The rotation of the
panels was activated by sun sensors so that the panels received maximum
sunlight. Seven experiments were mounted on the solar panels (the SOEP
package). An additional axis, oriented vertically across the front of the main
body, carried seven experiments (the OPEP package). Nominally, these sensors
observed in a forward direction in the orbital plane of the satellite. The
sensors could be rotated more than 90 deg relative to the nominal observing
position and more than 90 deg between the upper and lower OPEP groups mounted
on either end of this axis. On June 22, 1969, the spacecraft potential dropped
significantly during sunlight operation and remained so during subsequent
sunlight operation. This unexplained shift affected seven experiments which
made measurements dependent upon knowledge of the spacecraft plasma sheath.
During October 1969, a string of solar cells failed, but the only effect of the
decreased power was to cause two experiments to change their mode of operation.
Also during October 1969, a combination of manual and automatic attitude
control was initiated, which extended the control gas lifetime of the attitude
control system. In August 1970, tape recorder (TR) no. 1 operation degraded, so
all recorded data were subsequently taken with TR no. 2. By September 1970,
power and equipment degradation left 14 experiments operating normally, 3
partially, and 9 off. From October 14, 1970, TR no. 2 was used only on
Wednesdays (world days) to conserve power and extend TR operation. In June
1971, the number of 'on' experiments decreased from 13 to 7, and on June 28,
1971, the spacecraft was placed in a spin-stabilized mode about the yaw (Z)
axis and turned off due to difficulties with spacecraft power. OGO 6 was turned
on again from October 10, 1971, through March 1972, for operation of experiment
25 by The Radio Research Laboratory, Japan.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Columbia, the oldest orbiter in the Shuttle fleet, is named after the Boston, Massachusetts based sloop captained by American Robert Gray. The spaceship Columbia has continued the pioneering legacy of its forebears, becoming the first Space Shuttle to fly into Earth orbit in 1981. Four sister ships joined the fleet over the next 10 years: Challenger, arriving in 1982 but destroyed four years later; Discovery, 1983; Atlantis, 1985; and Endeavour, built as a replacement for Challenger, 1991. A test vehicle, the Enterprise, was used for suborbital approach and landing tests and did not fly in space.

Columbia was the first on-line orbiter to undergo the scheduled inspection and retrofit program. It was transported August 10, 1991, after its completion of mission STS-40, to prime Shuttle contractor Rockwell International's Palmdale, California assembly plant. The oldest orbiter in the fleet underwent approximately 50 modifications, including the addition of carbon brakes, drag chute, improved nose wheel steering, removal of development flight instrumentation and an enhancement of its thermal protection system. The orbiter returned to KSC February 9, 1992 to begin processing for mission STS-50 in June of that year.

On October 8, 1994, Columbia was transported to Palmdale California for its first ODMP. Approximately 90 modifications and upgrades were made to Columbia during this 6 month period. Modifications included upgrades to the main landing gear thermal barrier, tire pressure monitoring system and radiator drive circuitry. (Reference KSC Press Release 113-94 and Shuttle Status Report 10/10/94)

On September 24, 1999, Columbia was transported to Palmdale California for its second ODMP. While in California, workers will perform more than 100 modifications on the vehicle. Columbia will be the second orbiter outfitted with the multi-functional electronic display system (MEDS) or "glass cockpit". Last year, Shuttle Atlantis had the full-color, flat-panel displays installed on its flight deck during an OMDP. The new system improves crew interaction with the orbiter during flight and reduces the high cost of maintaining the outdated electromechanical cockpit displays currently onboard. (Reference KSC Press Release 74-99).

On February 1, 2003, Columbia was lost during re-entry into Earth's atmosphere.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">ATS 3 was launched in November 1967 and was one of a series of spacecraft
designed to demonstrate the utility and feasibility of a variety of
technological and scientific activities that could be carried out by an
earth-synchronous spacecraft.  Of the 11 experiments on board, 8 were
technological engineering experiments concerned with navigation,
communications, and spacecraft operation equipment; 2 were photographic imaging
experiments that produced near real-time daylight pictures of the
earth-atmosphere system; and the remaining experiment was an ionospheric
beacon.  The spin-stabilized spacecraft was cylindrically shaped and measured
180 cm in length and 142 cm in diameter.  The primary structural members were
a honeycombed equipment shelf and thrust tube.  Support rods extended radially
outward from the thrust tube and were affixed to solar panels which formed the
outer walls of the spacecraft.  Equipment components and payload were mounted
in the annular space between the thrust tube and solar panels.  In addition to
solar panels, the spacecraft was equipped with two rechargeable nickel-cadmium
batteries to provide electrical power.

This satellite supported an image dissector camera, multicolor spin scan
cloud cover camera, weather facsimile data relay system, omega position and
location equipment designed to demonstrate the feasibility of using the NAVY's
Omega Navigation System, and VHF, telemetry, and command antennas.  Spacecraft
guidance and orbital corrections were accomplished by 2.3 kg hydrogen peroxide
and hydrazine thrusters, which were activated by ground command.  Initially
placed at 48 degrees West over the Atlantic Ocean in a geosynchronous orbit,
the satellite position later varied between 45 and 95 degrees West in support
of meteorological operations.  In general, the various experiments were
successful.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">BE-C   (Explorer  27)  was  a  small  ionospheric  research  satellite instrumented  with  an  electrostatic  probe, radio beacons, a passive laser  tracking  reflector,  and a Doppler navigation experiment.  Its primary  objective  was  to  obtain  worldwide  observations  of total electron  content between the spacecraft and the earth.  The satellite was  initially  spin  stabilized, but it was despun after solar paddle erection.   Subsequent  stabilization  oriented  the satellite axis of symmetry with the local magnetic field by means of a strong bar magnet and  damping rods.  A three-axis magnetometer and sun sensors provided information  on  the  satellite  attitude and spin rate.  There was no tape   recorder   aboard   so  that  satellite  performance  data  and electrostatic  probe  data  were  observed only when the satellite was within  range  of a ground telemetry station.  Continuous transmitters operated  at  162  and 324 MHz to permit precise tracking by 'Transit' tracking  stations for navigation and geodetic studies.  The satellite was  turned  off  on July 20, 1973, due to frequency interference with higher priority spacecraft.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Alouette-2 was a small space based ionospheric observatory instrumented
with a sweep-frequency ionospheric sounder (radio transmitter), a VLF radio
receiver, an energetic particle detector experiment, a cosmic radio noise
experiment, and an electrostatic plasma probe.

EXTERIOR ANTENNAS:  The spacecraft used two long dipole antennas
(73 meter and 22.8 meter, respectively) for the sounder, VLF, and radio
cosmic noise experiments.

SPACECRAFT ROTATION (SPIN):   The satellite was spin-stabilized at
about 2.25 rpm after antenna deployment.  End plates on the 73 meter
antenna corrected the rapid despin that had occurred on the predecessor
spacecraft, Alouette 1, and which was believed to result from thermal
distortion of the antenna and from radiation pressure.

DATA ACQUISITION:  There was no onboard tape recorder, so that data
were available to the ground receiving station only when the spacecraft
was in direct line of sight of telemetry stations.  Telemetry stations
were located  so that primary data coverage was near the 80 degrees
West meridan plus areas near Hawaii, Singapore, Australia, England,
India, Norway and Central Africa.  Initially data were recorded about
8 hours per day.  Degradation of the power supply system had, by June
1975, reduced the operating time to about 1/2 hour per day.  Routine
operations were terminated in July 1975.  The spacecraft was also
successfully reactivated on November 28 and 29, 1975, in order to
obtain data on its 10th anniversary.

DMSP-5D-1/F1 was one of a series of meteorological satellites developed and operated by the Air Force under the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). This program, previously known as DAAP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objectives of this program were to provide global visual and infrared cloud cover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense requirements. Operationally, the program consisted of two satellites in planned 83-km sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other at local noon. The 5.4-m-long spacecraft was separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform (PMP) for sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment, (2) an equipment support module (ESM) containing the electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors, (3) a reaction control equipment (RCE) support structure (that has the third-stage motor, hydrazine reaction control system) which supports (4) a 9.29 sq m solar cell panel. The Block 5D spacecraft stabilization was controlled by a conbination flywheel and magnetic control coil system so sensors could be maintained in the desired 'earth-looking' mode. One feature of Block 5D was the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allowed automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element. The operational line scan system (OLS) built by Westinghouse, was the primary acquisition system that provided real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night visual and infrared imagery at 1/3 nautical mile resolution for all major land masses, 1-1/2 nautical mile resolution for complete global coverage, and provided with this data calibration, timing, and other auxiliary signals to the spacecraft for digital transmission to the ground. A supplementary sensor package, the special sensor H (SSH), a step-scanning radiometer, was the infrared temperature-humidity-ozone sounder. The data processing system, which included three high-density tape recorders, could store a total of 400 min of data, each allowing full global coverage twice daily. Either recorded or real-time data were transmitted to ground-receiving sites via two redundant s-band transmitters. Recorded data were read out to tracking sites located at Fairchild AFB, WA, and Loring AFB, ME, and relayed via SATCOM to Air Force Global Weather Central, Offutt AFB, NE. Real-time data were read out at mobile tactical sites located around the world. A more complete description of the Block 5D satellite can be found in the report, 'The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program,' D. A. Nichols, Optical Engineering, 14, 4, July - August 1975.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Solar Mesosphere Explorer (SME) mission objective was primarily to
investigate the processes that create and destroy ozone in the Earth's
mesosphere and upper stratosphere. Some specific goals were (1) to
determine the nature and magnitude of changes in mesospheric ozone
densities resulting from changes in the solar ultraviolet flux; (2) to
determine the interrelationship between solar flux, ozone, and the
temperature of the upper stratosphere and mesosphere; (3) to determine
the interrelationship between ozone and water vapor; and (4) to
determine the interrelationship between nitrogen dioxide and
ozone. The satellite experiment complement consisted of a solar
ultraviolet spectrometer, an ultraviolet ozone spectrometer, an
infrared radiometer, a 1.27-micrometer spectrometer, and a nitrogen
dioxide spectrometer. In addition, a solar proton alarm detector was
carried on board to measure the integrated solar flux in the range 30
to 500 MeV. Spin stabilized at 5 rpm, the satellite moved in a 3
a.m. to 3 p.m. sun-synchronous orbit. The spacecraft body was a
cylinder approximately 1.7 by 1.25 m and consisted of two major
modules: the observatory module that housed the scientific
instruments, and the spacecraft bus. The spin axis was oriented normal
to the orbital plane. The command system was capable of executing
commands in real time or from stored program control. Power was
supplied by a solar cell array. The telemetry system was used either
in a real-time or in a tape-recorder mode. Further details and some
measurement results are written in C. A. Barth et al., 'Solar
mesosphere explorer: scientific objectives and results,'
Geophys. Res. Lett., v. 10, no. 4, p. 237, 1983. All instruments on
board the SME were turned off in December 1988 because of energy
considerations.

Mission Objectives:

Meteor 2-21 is the twenty-first and last in the Meteor-2 series of Russian meteorological satellites launched in 1993. The Meteor satellites were designed to monitor atmospheric and sea-surface temperatures, humidity, radiation, sea-ice conditions, snow-cover, and clouds.

What makes Meteor 2-21 distinctive from the other meteorological satellites is its unique retroreflector array. Fizeau is named after a French physicist, Armand Fizeau, who in 1851 conducted an experiment which tested for the aether convection coefficient. SLR tracking of this satellite was used for precise orbit determination and the Experiment of Fizeau. The Fizeau Experiment tests the theory of special relativity-that distance events that are simultaneous for one observer will not be simultaneous for an observer in motion relative to the first.
Mission Instrumentation:

Meteor-2-21/Fizeau had the following instrumentation onboard:

   1. Scanning telephotometer
   2. Scanning infrared radiometers
   3. Radiation measurement complex
   4. Retroreflector array

[Mission Canceled]

Surface deformation is linked directly to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and landslides. Observations of surface deformation are used to forecast the likelihood of earthquakes occurring as a function of location, as well as predicting both the place and time that volcanic eruptions and landslides are likely. Advances in earthquake science leading to improved time-dependent probabilities would be significantly facilitated by global observations of surface deformation, and could result in significant increases in the health and safety of the public due to decreased exposure to tectonic hazards. Monitoring surface deformation is also important for improving the safety and efficiency of extraction of hydrocarbons, for managing our ground water resources, and, in the future, providing information for managing CO2 sequestration.

Mission Objectives

- Determine the likelihood of earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and landslides.
- Predict the response of ice sheets to climate change and impact on the sea level.
- Characterize the effects of changing climate and land use on species habitats and carbon budget.
- Monitor the migration of fluids associated with hydrocarbon production and groundwater resources.

This mission combines two sensors that, taken together, provide observations important for solid-Earth (surface deformation), ecosystems (terrestrial biomass structure) and climate (ice dynamics). The sensors are: 1) an L-band Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) system with multiple polarization, and 2) a multiple beam lidar operating in the infrared (~ 1064 nm) with ~ 25 m spatial resolution and 1 m vertical accuracy. The mission using InSAR to meet the science measurement objectives for surface deformation, ice sheet dynamics, and ecosystem structure has been extensively studied. It requires a satellite in 700-800 km sun-synchronous orbit in order to maximize available power from the solar arrays. An eight day revisit frequency balances temporal de-correlation with required coverage. Onboard GPS achieves cm-level orbit and baseline knowledge to improve calibration. The mission should have a 5 year life time to capture time-variable processes and achieve measurement accuracy.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Lockheed's Electra provided a number of airlines with their introduction to turbine powered aircraft. Today it remains popular with freight operators.

The Lockheed L-188 Electra was developed to meet a 1954 American Airlines requirement for a domestic short to medium range 75 to 100 seat airliner. In June 1955 American awarded Lockheed an order for 35 such aircraft. Lockheed's design, the L-188, was a low wing, four turboprop powered aircraft. Many other airlines shared American's interest in the L-188, and by the time the first prototype flew on December 6 1957, the order book stood at 144. Service entry was with Eastern Airlines (due to a pilot's strike at American) on January 12 1959.

However, any optimism Lockheed felt about a strong sales future would have been short lived, as a number of crashes in 1959 and 1960 (two of which where the aircraft broke up in flight) contributed to a number of order cancellations.

As an interim measure following the crashes, speed restrictions were imposed on Electras. Investigations uncovered a design defect with the engine mountings where the wing would shake and eventually break up. Lockheed undertook a significant modification program where the nacelles, nacelle mountings and wing structure were strengthened, and the speed restrictions were eventually lifted in 1961. After that the Electra proved reliable and popular in service, but the damage had been done and production wound up in 1961 after 170 had been built.

Lockheed built two basic versions of the Electra. The L-188A was the basic production aircraft, and accounted for most Electra sales. The L-188C entered service with KLM in 1959 and had greater fuel capacity and higher weights, and thus improved payload range performance.

The Electra also forms the basis for the hugely successful P-3 Orion long range maritime surveillance aircraft of which more than 600 have been built.

Most Electras currently in service are configured as freighters. From 1967 Lockheed converted 41 Electras to freighters or convertible freighter/passenger aircraft, fitting a strengthened floor and a large cargo door forward of the wing on the left side. Other companies have also converted Electras to freighters. However, a small number remain in passenger service.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">  The  Echo  2  spacecraft  was  a  41-m  balloon of aluminum foil-mylar
  laminate.   Echo  2 was designed as a rigidized passive communications
  spacecraft   for  testing  propagation,  tracking,  and  communication
  techniques.   Instrumentation  included a beacon telemetry system that
  provided  a  tracking  signal,  monitored  spacecraft skin temperature
  between  -120  deg C and +16 deg C, and measured the internal pressure
  of  the  spacecraft  between 5E-5 mm of mercury and 0.5 mm of mercury,
  especially  during  the  initial inflation stages.  This system, which
  consisted  of  two beacon assemblies, used solar cell panels for power
  and  had a minimum power output of 45 mW at 136.17 MHz and 136.02 MHz.
  In  addition  to fulfilling its communications mission, the spacecraft
  was  used for global geometric geodesy.  The spacecraft re-entered the
  atmosphere on June 7, 1969.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Nimbus-6 was launched in June 1975 and was a research-and-development
satellite serving as a stabilized, earth-oriented platform for testing advanced
systems for sensing and collecting meteorological data on a global scale. The
polar-orbiting spacecraft consisted of three major structures: (1) a hollow
torus-shaped sensor mount, (2) solar paddles, and (3) a control housing unit
connected to the sensor mount by a tripod truss structure.  Configured somewhat
like an ocean buoy, Nimbus-6 was nearly 3.7 m tall, 1.5 m in diameter at the
base, and about 3 m wide with solar paddles extended.  The sensor mount that
formed the satellite base housed the electronics equipment and battery modules.
The lower surface of the torus provided mounting space for sensors and
antennas. A box-beam structure mounted within the center of the torus supported
the larger sensor experiments.  Mounted on the control housing unit, which was
located on top of the spacecraft, were sun sensors, horizon scanners, and a
command antenna. The spacecraft spin axis was pointed at the earth. An advanced
attitude-control system permitted the spacecraft's orientation to be controlled
to within plus or minus 1 degree in all three axes (pitch, roll, and yaw).
The experiments selected for Nimbus-6 were the earth radiation budget (ERB),
electrically scanning microwave radiometer (ESMR), high-resolution infrared
radiation sounder (HIRS), limb radiance inversion radiometer (LRIR), pressure
modulated radiometer (PMR), scanning microwave spectrometer (SCAMS),
temperature-humidity infrared radiometer (THIR), tracking and data relay
experiment (T+DRE), and the tropical wind energy conversion and reference level
experiment (TWERLE). This complement of advanced sensors was capable of mapping
tropospheric temperature, water vapor abundance, and cloud water content;
providing vertical profiles of temperature, ozone, and  water vapor;
transmitting real-time data to a geostationary spacecraft (ATS 6); and yielding
data on the earth's radiation budget.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">                  - Spacecraft Brief Description -
The GEOdetic SATellite (GEOSAT) was a dedicated US Navy military oceanographic
satellite consisting of a radar altimeter designed to obtain closely spaced,
precise mapping of the earth's geoid over the ocean. On November 8, 1986, the
satellite was moved into an Exact Repeat Mission (ERM) orbit with a repeat
cycle of 17.05 days. The GEOSAT mission was originally managed by the Office of
Naval Research (ONR). During the development phase, the program responsibility
was transferred to the Naval Electronics Systems Command, now called the Space
and Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) in Washington, D.C. The Applied
Physics Laboratory (APL) was the prime contractor for the spacecraft and radar
altimeter and performed spacecraft command and control operations and collected
the satellite data. The data was distributed to the Naval Surface Weapons
Center (NSWC), the Naval Ocean Research and Development Activity (NORDA), and
NOAA. An arrangement was made with the National Ocean Service of NOAA to obtain
the classified GEOSAT geophysical data records (GDR) providing wind, wave and
sea-level products and made available to the user community. NASA obtained
GEOSAT data for extensive waveform modeling and ice sheet research.The basic
structure of the GEOSAT is similar to the GEOS-3 satellite: The design consists
of a conical structure below the core for the structural attachment of the
velocity control system. The GEOSAT attitude control subsystem was designed to
point the radar altimeter to within 1 degree of nadir 98 percent of the time.
The system components were a 20-foot scissors boom with 100-pound end mass,
redundant momentum wheels for roll and yaw stiffness, and pitch and roll
attitude control thrusters. Attitude sensing was provided through the use of
three digital sun-attitude detectors and a three-axis vector magnetometer.
Spacecraft command was accomplished via a VHF uplink from the APL ground
station. The telemetry subsystem consisted of two S-band transmitters, two tape
recorders, and two encryption units. The GEOSAT was equipped with two Odetics
dual-track high-density tape recorders that independently recorded the 10.205
kbps telemetry stream and played it back at 833 kbps for transmission to the
ground. The GEOSAT also included redundant Doppler beacons for continuous
tracking by a network of ground stations within the Defense Mapping Agency
(DMA) and for a source of accurate timing to the radar altimeter and the
telemetry subsystem. A C-band transponder was also included on GEOSAT. See

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">SORCE is a NASA-sponsored satellite mission that will provide state-of-the-art
measurements of incoming x-ray, ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared, and total
solar radiation. SORCE represents the merging of the EOS Solar Stellar
Irradiance Comparison Experiment (SOLSTICE) and the Total Solar Irradiance
Mission (TSIM). The measurements provided by SORCE specifically address
long-term climate change, natural variability and enhanced climate prediction,
and atmospheric ozone and UV-B radiation. These measurements are critical to
studies of the Sun, its effect on our Earth system, and its influence on
humankind.

Solar radiation is the dominant, direct energy input into the terrestrial
ecosystem, and it affects all physical, chemical, and biological processes. The
Sun provides a natural influence on the Earth's atmosphere and climate. In
order to understand mankind's roles in climate change, the Sun's impact must
first be understood.

SORCE measures the Sun's output with the use of state-of-the-art radiometers,
spectrometers, photodiodes, detectors, and bolometers engineered into
instruments mounted on a satellite observatory. The SORCE satellite orbits
around the Earth accumulating solar data. Spectral measurements identify the
irradiance of the Sun by characterizing the Sun's energy and emissions in the
form of color that can then be translated into quantities and elements of
matter. Data obtained by the SORCE experiment will be used to model the Sun's
output and to explain and predict the effect of the Sun's radiation on the
Earth's atmosphere and climate.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The SPAS (Shuttle Pallet Satellite) satellite was a reusable free-flying vehicle built by Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm.which could be deployed and then retrieved by the US Space Shuttle's Remote Manipulator System arm. The original SPAS, with materials processing and SDI-related sensor payloads, was used on several missions (STS-7, STS-11, STS-39). An experiment-carrying truss (USS) based on the original SPAS structure (but without the avionics and attitude control) was flown on the Spacelab D-1 and D-2 missions.

The shuttle was launched on April 28, 1991 and landed May 6, 1991. Unclassified payload included the Infrared Background Signature Survey (IBSS) with Critical Ionization Velocity (CIV), Chemical Release Observation (CRO) and Shuttle Pallet Satellite-II (SPAS-II) experiments; and Space Test Payload-1 (STP-1). Classified payload consisted of Multi-Purpose Release Canister (MPEC). Also on board was Radiation Monitoring Equipment III (RME III) and Cloud Logic to Optimize Use of Defense Systems-1A (CLOUDS-1).

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">NOAA-8 was launched in March 1983 and was a third-generation operational
meteorological satellite for use in the National Environmental Satellite Data
and Information Service (NESDIS) of NOAA.  NOAA-8 was the first spacecraft of
the advanced TIROS-N (ATN) series.  The satellite design provided an economical
and stable sun-synchronous platform for advanced operational instruments to
measure the earth's atmosphere, its surface and cloud cover, and the near-space
environment.  The satellite was based upon the Block 5D spacecraft bus
developed for the U.S. Air Force, and it was capable of maintaining an
earth-pointing accuracy of better than plus or minus 0.1 degree with a motion
rate of less than 0.035 degree/second.
Primary sensors included an Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)
and a TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS). Secondary experiments
consisted of a Space Environment Monitor (SEM) and a Data Collection and
Platform Location System (DCPLS).  A Search and Rescue Satellite Aided Tracking
(SARSAT) system was also included on NOAA-8.  Although designed for a 2-year
life span, NOAA-8 experienced a premature failure in June 1984.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The basic configuration of the Be-200 amphibious aircraft is indended for fighting the forest fires using the fire extinguishant fluids. While doing this, the aircraft can fulfill the following tasks:

- stop and restrain the spread of the big forest fires by developing the protecting strip due to multiple drops on the fire edge;

- extinguishing the small fire and fire which only starts to develop;

- delivery of fire brigades and fire extingushing equipment to the fire region by landing on preselected water area of aifield, and return to the base. 

A particular feature of the Be-200 aircraft, when compared with the other amphibians, is that it has fully pressurized fuselage, which allows to fulfill a lot of missions.

The aircraft is fitted with flight/navigation and communication equipment allowing the navigation and flight control at all flight phases in adverse weather conditions at any season, day and night.

The Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) is the restructured civilian portion of the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) that will make afternoon observations as it orbits Earth. The system includes the satellites and sensors supporting civil weather and climate measurements and a shared ground infrastructure with the Department of Defense weather satellite system.


NOAA is responsible for the JPSS program. NASA is the program’s procurement agent, and the agency’s 

Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., is the lead for acquisition. Data and imagery obtained from JPSS will increase the timeliness, accuracy and cost-effectiveness of public warnings and forecasts of climate and weather events, reducing the potential loss of human life and property.

Polar-orbiting satellites observe Earth from space and collect and disseminate data on Earth’s weather, atmosphere, oceans, land, and near-space environment and are able to monitor the entire planet and provide data for long-range weather and climate forecasts.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Space Shuttle Discover was the the third orbiter to become operational at Kennedy Space Center, was named after one of two ships that were used by the British explorer James Cook in the 1770s during voyages in the South Pacific that led to the discovery of the Hawaiian Islands. Another of his ships was the Endeavour, the namesake of NASA's newest orbiter.

Discovery benefited from lessons learned in the construction and testing of Enterprise, Columbia and Challenger. At rollout, its weight was some 6,870 pounds less than Columbia. Two orbiters, Challenger and Discovery, were modified at KSC to enable them to carry the Centaur upper stage in the payload bay. These modifications included extra plumbing to load and vent Centaur's cryogenic (L02/LH2) propellants (other IUS/PAM upper stages use solid propellants), and controls on the aft flight deck for loading and monitoring the Centaur stage. No Centaur flight was ever flown and after the loss of Challenger it was decided that the risk was too great to launch a shuttle with a fueled Centaur upper stage in the payload bay.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">he S-3B Viking was built to take off and land on carrier ships, fly into enemy territory and take out threatening submarines. It's rugged, fast and powerful, but its fighting days are numbered.

Though the United States Navy is slowly decommissioning the fleet, one S-3B is still flying in hostile conditions. Its next mission? Venture into hazardous weather to study a phenomenon that has caused more than 100 commercial aircraft engines to fail, stall or temporarily lose power.

Engineers from NASA's Glenn Research Center, Boeing and the Navy have combined forces to transform the S-3B into a state-of-the-art NASA research aircraft. Last month, NASA Glenn unveiled the modified plane in Cleveland.

"We were able to capitalize on the decommissioning by acquiring the aircraft directly from the Navy," explained Dr. Rickey Shyne, director of Glenn's Facilities and Test Directorate. "This saved taxpayers millions of dollars compared to the cost of a new aircraft."

Workers at the Navy's Fleet Readiness Center - Southeast and a Boeing facility in Fla. enhanced the plane by adding commercial satellite communications, global positioning navigation and weather radar systems. They installed research equipment racks in what was once the plane's bomb bay. And they gave it a shiny blue-and-white NASA paint job.

With these new features, NASA's S-3B Viking is equipped to conduct science and aeronautics missions, such as environmental monitoring, satellite communications testing and aviation safety research. It can fly up to 40,000 feet high and reach speeds faster than 500 miles per hour, which makes it perfect for studying commercial airline safety issues.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">NOAA-5 was launched in July 1976 and was one in a series of
reconfigured ITOS satellites launched with new meteorological sensors
onboard to expand the operational capability of the ITOS system.  The
primary objective was to provide global daytime and nighttime direct
readout real-time cloudcover data on a daily basis. The
sun-synchronous spacecraft was also capable of supplying global
atmospheric temperature soundings and very high resolution infrared
cloudcover data for selected areas in either a direct readout or a
tape-recorder mode. A secondary objective was to obtain global
solar-proton flux data on a real-time daily basis. The sensors were
mounted on the satellite baseplate with their optical axes directed
vertically earthward. The nearly cubical spacecraft measured 1 by 1 by
1.2 m. The satellite was equipped with three curved solar panels that
were folded during launch and deployed after orbit was achieved. Each
panel measured over 4.2 m in length when unfolded and was covered with
approximately 3500 solar cells measuring 2 by 2 cm. The dynamics and
attitude control system maintained desired spacecraft orientation
through gyroscopic principles incorporated into the satellite
design. Earth orientation of the satellite body was maintained by
taking advantage of the precession induced from a momentum flywheel so
that the satellite body precession rate of one revolution per orbit
provided the desired 'earth-looking' attitude. Minor adjustments in
attitude and orientation were made by means of magnetic coils and by
varying the speed of the momentum flywheel.
The primary sensors consisted of a Very High Resolution Radiometer
(VHRR), Vertical Temperature Profile Radiometer (VTPR), and a Scanning
Radiometer (SR).  The spacecraft was placed in a sun-synchronous orbit
with equatorial crossing of the ascending node near 8:30 a.m. local
time.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Solar-B (Hinode) is an international mission to study our nearest star, the
sun. To accomplish this, the Solar-B mission includes a suite of three science
instruments -- the Solar Optical Telescope, X-ray Telescope and Extreme
Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer. SOLAR-B is the third solar physics satellite
of JAXA which was approved as a successor of the highly successful Japan/US/UK
YOHKOH (SOLAR-A) collaboration. 

Together, these instruments will study the generation, transport, and
dissipation of magnetic energy from the photosphere to the corona and will
record how energy stored in the sun's magnetic field is released, either
gradually or violently, as the field rises into the sun?s outer atmosphere.

Led by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), the Solar-B mission is a
collaboration between the space agencies of Japan, the United States, the
United Kingdom and Europe. NASA helped in the development, funding and assembly
of the spacecraft?s three science instruments. Solar-B is part of the Solar
Terrestrial Probes (STP) Program within the Heliophysics Division of NASA's
Science Mission Directorate in Washington. The Solar Terrestrial Probes Program
is managed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. NASA's
Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., managed the development of
instrument components provided by NASA, with additional support by academia and
industry.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Spacecraft Brief Description
    The  Insat-1  satellite program incorporated two three-axis stabilized
    spacecraft  in  geostationary  orbit  (Insat-1A  at  74  degrees E and
    Insat-1B  at  94  degrees E) with a host of ground stations throughout
    India.   The  Insat-1A  satellite,  built  by  the  Ford Aerospace and
    Communications   Corporation,   was   designed   to  provide  combined
    telecommunications, direct TV broadcast, and meteorological service to
    India's  civilian  community  over  a  7-year-in-orbit  lifespan.  The
    telecommunications  package  provided two-way, long distance telephone
    circuits and direct radio and TV broadcasting to the remotest areas of
    India.     The   meteorology   package  was  composed  of  a  scanning
    very-high-resolution,   two-channel   radiometer   (VHRR)  to  provide
    full-frame,  full-earth coverage every 30 minutes.  The visual channel
    (0.55-0.75  micrometer)  had a 2.75-km resolution while the IR channel
    (10.5-12.5  micrometers)  had an 11-km resolution.  Using the Insat TV
    capability,  early  warnings  of  impending  disasters  (i.e., floods,
    storms,  etc.)  could  directly reach the civilian population, even in
    remote  areas.   The  Insat-1A  also  had  a data channel for relaying
    meteorological,  hydrological,  and oceanographic data from unattended
    land-based  or ocean-based data collection and transmission platforms.
    *Insat-1A was abandoned in September 1983 when its attitude
     control propellant was exhausted*

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Atmospheric Explorer-D (AE-D) spacecraft (designation: 08353 /
75096A ) was designed as a multi- sided polyhedron shaped frame with a
mean diameter of about 1.4 meters.  AE-D was in most respects similar
to AE-C. The AE-D was launched on 1975-10-6 and decayed 1976-03-12.
The purpose of the AE-D mission was a direct continuation of the EA-C
mission: to investigate the chemical and physical processes in the
uppermost layer of the earth's atmosphere, the thermosphere, with
emphasis on energy transfer and other controlling processes.
Photochemical processes related to the absorption of solar UV
radiation were studied by making coordinated measurements of reacting
constituents and the solar input in the region of high absorption of
solar energy.

The payload included instrumentation to measure: Solar UV Fluxes, the
Composition of Positive Ions and Neutral Particles, the Density and
Temperature of neutral particles, positive ions and electrons,
Atmospheric airglow emissions, Photoelectron Energy Spectra, and
Proton and Electron Fluxes with particle energy up to 25 keV.
This mission was planned to sample the high latitude regions at the
same time that the AE-E mission was sampling the equatorial and low
latitude regions.  The same type of spacecraft as AE-C was used, and
the payload consisted of the same types of instruments except for
deletion of the extreme solar UV monitor and the Bennett ion mass
spectrometer both of which were part of the AE-E payload.
AE-D was placed in a high inclination (polar) orbit.  The polar orbit
provided sampling of all latitudes, the perigee moved through all
latitudes in 3 months, and all local times in 4 months.
Unfortunately, a failure in the solar power panels resulted in the
termination of AE-D operations on January 29, 1976, after slightly
less than 4 months of useful spacecraft life.  However, all the
regions at the perigee altitudes were sampled during this time.  The
AE-D spacecraft re-entered the earth's atmosphere about 1 month after
the cessation of telemetry.  To continue the correlated observations
with the AE-E mission, the earlier AE-C spacecraft was then
reactivated on February 28, 1976 as replacecment for AE-D. Power to
AE-D was supplied by a solar cell array.  The spacecraft used a PCM
telemetry data system that operated in real time or using a tape
recorder.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">he Convair 990 Coronado was an enhanced version of the Convair 880. Specifically, it was 10 feet longer, could hold as many as 39 more passengers, and has anti-shock bodies extending back from the trailing edge of the wing (see picture below).

General Dynamics, the parent company of Convair, was the third American aerospace company to enter the jet race behind Boeing with its 707 and Douglas with its DC-9. Being third was a distinct disadvantage as most airlines had already purchased jets before the first Convair ever flew. However, Convair believed it could win with a jet that would be the fastest civilian aircraft in the skies.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">During the 10 day mission, the Space Radar Laboratory (SRL) payload in Endeavour's cargo bay will make its second flight. The SRL payload, which first flew during STS-59 in April 1994, will again give scientists highly detailed information that will help them distinguish between human-induced environmental changes and other natural forms of change.

SRL-2 will take radar images of the Earth's surface for Earth system sciences studies, including geology, geography, hydrology, oceanography, agronomy and botany.

The SRL payload is comprised of the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR), and the Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellite (MAPS). The German Space Agency (DARA) and the Italian Space Agency (ASI) are providing the X-SAR instrument.

The imaging radar of the SIR-C/X-SAR instruments has the ability to make measurements over virtually any region at any time, regardless of weather or sunlight conditions. The radar waves can penetrate clouds, and under certain conditions, also can "see" through vegetation, ice and extremely dry sand. In many cases, radar is the only way scientists can explore inaccessible regions of the Earth's surface. 

The SIR-C/X-SAR radar data provide information about how many of Earth's complex systems - those processes that control the movement of land, water, air and life - work together to make this a livable planet. The science team particularly wants to study the amount of vegetation coverage, the extent of snow packs, wetlands areas, geologic features such as rock types and their distribution, volcanic activity, ocean wave heights and wind speed. STS-68 will fly over the same sites that STS-59 observed so that scientists will be able to study seasonal changes that may have occurred in those areas between the missions.

An international team of 49 science investigators and three associates will conduct the SIR-C/X-SAR experiments. Thirteen nations are represented: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and the United States.

The MAPS experiment will measure the global distribution of carbon monoxide in the troposphere, or lower atmosphere. Measurements of carbon monoxide, an important element in several chemical cycles, provide scientists with indications of how well the atmosphere can cleanse itself of "greenhouse gases," chemicals that can increase the atmosphere's temperature.

STS-68 provided a continuation of NASA's Get Away Special (GAS) experiments program. The project gives a person or organization a chance to perform experiments in space on a Shuttle mission. Two universities, North Carolina A&amp;T State University and University of Alabama in Huntsville, and the Swedish Space Corp., Soina, Sweden, will have small self-contained payloads flying during the STS-68 mission. Other GAS hardware in Endeavour's payload bay will carry 500,000 commemorative stamps for the U.S. Postal Service in recognition of the 25th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing.

Other payloads aboard Endeavour include the Biological Research in Canister (BRIC) which will fly for the first time, and the Military Applications of Ship Tracks (MAST) which will be making its second flight. BRIC experiments, sponsored by NASA's Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences and Applications, are designed to examine the effects of microgravity on a wide range of physiological processes in higher order plants and arthropod animals (e.g., insects, spiders, centipedes, crustaceans). MAST is an experiment sponsored by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and is part of a five-year research program developed by ONR to examine the effects of ships on the marine environment.

The Commercial Protein Crystal Growth (CPCG) experiment, the Chromosome and Plant Cell Division in Space Experiment (CHROMEX) and the Cosmic Radiation Effects and Activation Monitor (CREAM) experiment also will be carried aboard Endeavour.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Monitor-E is a Russian Earth observation mission of KhSC (Khrunichev Space Center) on a small-class generic satellite series. The spacecraft was also designed and developed by KhSC of Moscow.

The Monitor-E mission represents the first operational use of the newly developed modular and multipurpose Yakhta platform, intended for use in various remote sensing, communications, and space research applications.

Spacecraft:

The spacecraft is 3-axis stabilized using the generic Yakhta platform with a launch mass of 750 kg. The attitude pointing accuracy is 0.1º, the attitude rate control accuracy is 0.001º/s (angular drift). Power of 1200 W (max at EOL) is provided by two solar panels. The spacecraft features a cross-track pointing capability of ±30º from nadir by using a flywheel system, thereby providing a FOR (Field of Regard) for observation coverage considerably beyond that of the nominal swath width. This new S/C agility is provided by the introduction of a CMG (Control Moment Gyro) subsystem, an actuator within the ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem), developed by Russian industry. KhSC refers to the ADCS as ICS (Integrated Control System). The S/C system design life is 5 years.

Note: The Monitor-E spacecraft is of Monitor-E heritage (same name of previous and current missions) which was launched on June 30, 2003 from Plesetsk on a Rockot KS vehicle. On this flight, Monitor-E functioned as a mock-up (or prototype) spacecraft of KhSC with a mass of 700 kg. The spacecraft Monitor-E remained attached to the upper stage of the launch vehicle, it was used for demonstration purposes. 

RF communications: The payload data are being received in X-band by ground stations of federal, regional, and local levels in Russia. An effort is being made to acquire the data in near real-time in support of fast reaction response applications.

Orbit: Sun-synchronous near-circular orbit: mean altitude = 540 km, inclination = 97.5º.

Launch: A launch of Monitor-E took place on Aug. 26, 2005 on a Rockot Breeze-KM launch vehicle of Eurockot Launch Services from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia.

Mission status: Monitor-E is operational as of 2007. So far, the spacecraft has collected imagery of more than 80 million km2.

• After launch and orbit insertion, the spacecraft experienced initial attitude control problems (flight controllers lost contact with the satellite). However, the flight controllers have regained control of Monitor-E, all systems are operating nominally and the spacecraft is in the commissioning phase as of early November 2005 (the checkout phase is estimated to last for up to 6 months to test the new components of the platform and the payload - and to conduct various operational experiments).

• In Sept. 2006, Monitor-E experienced a malfunction of its ADCS (Attitude Determination and Control Subsystem). After analysis of the problem nature, a software work-around procedure was developed and successfully installed onboard.

GPM Constellation is a joint mission with the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) and other international partners. Building upon the success of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), it will initiate the measurement of global precipitation, a key climate factor. Its science objectives are: to improve ongoing efforts to predict climate by providing near-global measurement of precipitation, its distribution, and physical processes; to improve the accuracy of weather and precipitation forecasts through more accurate measurement of rain rates and latent heating; and to provide more frequent and complete sampling of the Earth's precipitation. GPM Constellation is envisioned to consist of a core spacecraft to measure precipitation structure and to provide a calibration standard for the constellation spacecraft, an international constellation of NASA and contributed spacecraft to provide frequent precipitation measurements on a global basis, calibration/validation sites distributed globally with a broad array of precipitation-measuring instrumentation, and a global precipitation data system to produce and distribute global rain maps and climate research products.

The GPM Core Observatory carries the first space-borne Ku/Ka-band Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) and a multi-channel GPM Microwave Imager (GMI). The DPR instrument, which provides three dimensional measurements of precipitation structure over 78 and 152 mile (125 and 245 km) swaths, consists of a Ka-band precipitation radar (KaPR) operating at 35.5 GHz and a Ku-band precipitation radar (KuPR) operating at 13.6 GHz. Relative to the TRMM precipitation radar, the DPR is more sensitive to light rain rates and snowfall. In addition, simultaneous measurements by the overlapping of Ka/Ku-bands of the DPR can provide new information on particle drop size distributions over moderate precipitation intensities. In addition, by providing new microphysical measurements from the DPR to complement cloud and aerosol observations, GPM is expected to provide further insights into how precipitation processes may be affected by human activities.

The GMI instrument is a conical-scanning multi-channel microwave radiometer covering a swath of 550 miles (885 km) with thirteen channels ranging in frequency from 10 GHz to 183 GHz. The GMI uses a set of frequencies that have been optimized over the past two decades to retrieve heavy, moderate and light precipitation using the polarization difference at each channel as an indicator of the optical thickness and water content.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Identical to Pioneer 6, Pioneer 7 was put into heliocentric orbit at 0.814 x 0.985 AU to study the solar magnetic field, the solar wind, and cosmic rays at widely separated points in solar orbit. 

On 7 September 1968, the spacecraft was correctly aligned with the Sun and Earth to begin studying Earth's magnetic tail. 

In 1977, eleven years after its launch, Pioneer 7 registered the magnetic tail 19.3 million kilometers out, three times further into space than recorded previously. 

On 20 March 1986, the spacecraft flew within 12.3 million kilometers of Halley's Comet and monitored the interaction between the cometary hydrogen tail and the solar wind. 

As with Pioneer 6 and Pioneer 8, NASA continues to maintain intermittent contact with Pioneer 7, more than thirty years after its mission began. On 31 March 1995, for example, the plasma analyzer was turned on during 2 hours of contact with the ground.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Cessna 172 Skyhawk is a four-seat, single-engine, high-wing airplane.

More Cessna 172s have been built than any other aircraft. It is probably the most popular flight training aircraft in the world.

Measured by its longevity and popularity, the Cessna 172 is the most successful mass produced light aircraft in history. The first production models were delivered in 1956 and they are still in production as of 2008; more than 43,000 have been built.[1] The Skyhawk's main competitors have been the Beechcraft Musketeer and Grumman AA-5 series (neither in production), the Piper Cherokee and, more recently, the Diamond DA40.

The Cessna 172 started life as a tricycle landing gear upgrade from the taildragger Cessna 170, with a basic level of standard equipment. The first flight of the prototype was in November 1955. The 172 became an overnight sales success and over 1400 were built in 1956, its first full year of production.

Early 172s were similar in appearance to the 170, with the same straight aft fuselage and tall gear legs, although the 172 had a straight vertical tail while the 170 had a rounded fin and rudder. Later 172 versions incorporated revised landing gear and the sweptback tail which is still in use today.The final aesthetic development in the mid-1960s, was a lowered rear deck that allowed an aft window. Cessna advertised this added rear visibility as "Omni-Vision" . This airframe configuration has remained almost unchanged since then, except for updates in avionics and engines, including the Garmin G1000 glass cockpit in 2005. Production had been halted in the mid-1980s, but was resumed in 1996 with the 160 hp (120 kW) Cessna 172R Skyhawk and was supplemented in 1998 by the 180 hp (135 kW) Cessna 172S Skyhawk SP.

DMSP 5D-2/F12, also known as USA 106, is one of a series of meteorological satellites developed and operated by the Air Force under the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). This program, previously known as DAPP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objective of this program is to provide global visual and infrared cloudcover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense operational weather analysis and forecasting requirements. Operationally, the program consists of two satellites in sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other at local noon.

The 6.4-m-long spacecraft is separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform for sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment; (2) an equipment support module containing the electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors; (3) a reaction control equipment support structure containing the third-stage rocket motor and supporting the ascent phase reaction control equipment; and (4) a 9.29-sq-m solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization is controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system so that sensors are maintained in the desired earth-looking mode. One feature is the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allows automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element.

The operational linescan system is the primary data acquisition system and provides real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night, visual and infrared imagery of clouds. A supplementary sensor package contains: (1) a microwave imager; (2) a microwave temperature sounder; (3) a microwave water vapor profiler; (4) an ion and electron scintillation monitor; (5) a precipitating electron/ion spectrometer; (6) a gamma/X-ray detector, and (7) a magnetometer.

Data are transmitted to ground receiving sites by two redundant S-band transmitters. Real-time data are received at tactical sites world-wide. Recorded data are transmitted to and processed by the Air Force Global Weather Central (AFGWC), Offutt AFB, Nebraska, and the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center (FNMOC), Monterey, California. Both AFGWC and FNMOC relay the SSM/I, SSM/T, and SSM/T2 data to the National Environmental Satellite Data and Information System (NESDIS). AFGWC also sends the entire data stream to the National Geophysical Data Center, Boulder, Colorado. Additional information concerning can be found in the report by D. A. Nichols, "The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program," Optical Engineering, v. 14, n. 4, p. 273, July-August 1975.

Description

SeaStar was a spacecraft, developed by Orbital Sciences Corporation, to deliver daily, worldwide, high precision, moderate resolution, multispectral visible observations of ocean radiance for research in biogeochemical processes, climate change, and oceanography. A near noon sun-synchronous orbit was flown for optimum illumination of the lighted hemisphere. Data were taken from a single ocean color scanner on-board the satellite (SeaWiFS - Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-View Sensor). The SeaStar spacecraft was launched into low Earth orbit via a Pegasus launch vehicle which was flown under the wing of a modified Lockheed L-1011 aircraft. The spacecraft had an on-board hydrazine propulsion system which was used to raise the satellite to its final 705 km circular, noon, sun-synchronous orbit. Final orbit was achieved 20 days after launch. The spacecraft was three-axis stabilized by an Attitude Control System (ACS) which consisted of orthogonal magnetic torque rods for roll and yaw control and two momentum wheels for pitch stabilization. ACS sensors included redundant sun sensors, horizon sensors, and magnetometers. The propulsion system consisted of a reaction control subsystem for third stage stabilization and a hydrazine propulsion subsystem for raising the space- craft to its operational orbit and for orbit stabilization. Local high resolution (1 km) data (LAC) were delivered by direct broadcast at L-Band to regional scientific centers nationwide. Reduced resolution (4 km) data (GAC and selected LAC) were directly broadcast at S-band to smaller research centers and ships at sea. All reduced resolution data and selected full resolution data were recorded on board and transmitted to GSFC via daily dump at S-Band or via the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS). A minimum three year mission life was expected.

The satellite stopped taking data on December 11, 2010 and was subsequently decommissioned.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The C-130 Hercules primarily performs the intratheater portion of the airlift mission. The aircraft is capable of operating from rough, dirt strips and is the prime transport for paradropping troops and equipment into hostile areas. Basic and specialized versions perform a diversity of roles, including airlift support, DEW Line and Arctic ice resupply, aeromedical missions, aerial spray missions, fire-fighting duties for the US Forest Service, and natural disaster relief missions. In recent years, they have been used to bring humanitarian relief to many countries, including Haiti, Bosnia, Somalia, and Rwanda.

Four decades have elapsed since the Air Force issued its original design specification, yet the remarkable C-130 remains in production. The turbo-prop, high-wing, versatile "Herc" has accumulated over 20 million flight hours. It is the preferred transport aircraft for many US Government services and over 60 foreign countries. The basic airframe has been modified to hundreds of different configurations to meet an ever-changing environment and mission requirement. The C-130 Hercules has unsurpassed versatility, performance, and mission effectiveness. Early C-130A, B, and D versions are now retired.

The mission objectives of GFO-1 (GEOSAT FOLLOW-ON-1) program the
U.S. Navy's initiative to develop an operational family of radar
altimeters satellites to maintain continuous ocean observation from
the GEOSAT exact repeat orbit. GFO-1 data will be used for precise
measurement of both mesoscale and basin-scale oceanography. The length
and time scales of these processes are too large for conventional
in-the-water oceanographic instrumentation configurations to
measure. Satellite altimetry is the only known method by which
oceanographers can precisely measure sea surface topography. The shape
of the sea surface is the only physical variable directly measurable
from space that is directly and simply connected to the large-scale
movement of water and the total mass and volume of the ocean.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">
The Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) was the first human
spaceflight mission managed jointly by two nations. It was
designed to test the compatibility of rendezvous and docking
systems for American and Soviet spacecraft in order to open the
way for future joint human flights. There were a number of
difficulties that both nations had to resolve in the mission
design before they could assure a safe docking of both
spacecraft and an on-orbit meeting of crewmembers. The technical
challenges included different measuring systems, the different
spacecraft and thus mating adapter designs, and different air
pressures and mixtures.

The Apollo spacecraft was the same design as those used on lunar
exploration missions. Several modifications were made for the
Apollo-Soyuz mission, however, including the addition of
propellants for the reaction control system, heaters for
temperature control, and extra equipment needed to operate the
Docking Module. The Soyuz had been the Soviet's primary
spacecraft since 1967. It consisted of three basic
modules?Orbital, Descent, and Instrument?no major modifications
were needed.

The mission began with the Soyuz launch on July 15, 1975,
followed by the Apollo launch seven hours later. The docking in
space of, the two spacecraft took place at 2:17
p.m. U.S. central time on July 17. Two days worth of joint
operations followed. After separation, the Soyuz remained in
space for almost two days before landing in the U.S.S.R. on July
21. The Apollo spacecraft remained in space for another three
days before splashing down near Hawaii on July 24.

The mission was a resounding success for both Americans and
Soviets. They achieved their goal of obtaining flight experience
for rendezvous and docking of human spacecraft. In addition,
they also demonstrated in-flight intervehicular crew transfer,
as well as accomplished a series of scientific experiments. The
ASTP mission was not only successful as a space effort, but the
mutual confidence and trust it engendered made it a huge step in
international cooperation during the Cold War.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">CHAMP will generate for the first time simultaneously highly precise gravity
and magnetic field measurements over a 5 years period. This will allow us to
detect besides the spatial variations of both fields also their variability
with time. The CHAMP mission will open a new era in geopotential research and
will become a significant contributor to the Decade of Geopotentials. It will
perform the following three tasks: 1) Mapping of the Earth's global long to
medium wavelength gravity field and temporal variations with applications in
the geophysics, geodesy and oceanography; 2) Mapping of the Earth's global
magnetic field and temporal variations with applications in geophysics and
solar terrestrial physics; 3) Atmosphere/ionosphere sounding with applications
in global climate studies, weather forecasting, disaster research and
navigation.

CHAMP-derived data will serve as an ideal basis for a further refinement of
modern satellite surveying methods and constructing digital terrain models
covering large land and ice areas for remote sensing applications and for
cartography. The evaluation of all three kinds of signals CHAMP will be
observing will allow a complete and integrated modeling of the structure and
dynamics of the Earth core and mantle. Such an improvement will strongly
enhance studies concerning the structure and composition of the Earth's
interior and will open new insights and application areas in geodesy, solid
Earth physics and oceanography.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">AIMP-2 (AIMP-E or IMP-E or Explorer 35, NSSDC ID: 76-070A) was a spin- stabilized 230 kg spacecraft instrumented for interplanetary studies at lunar distances.  It was successfully 'anchored' to the earth's moon, and stayed that way during its operational life.  The AIMP-2 sensors were designed to study the interplanetary plasmas, the magnetic fields, fluxes of energetic particles, and solar X-rays.  The spacecraft was launched into an elliptical lunar orbit.  The spin axis direction was nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic plane, and the AIMP-2 spin rate was 25.6 rpm, giving a spin period of 2.34 sec.  The overall AIMP-2 mission objectives were achieved.  After successful operation and data gathering for 6 years, the spacecraft was turned off on June 24, 1973.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">BE-B   (Explorer  22)  was  a  small  ionospheric  research  satellite instrumented  with an electrostatic probe, a 20-, 40-, and 41-Hz radio beacon,  a  passive laser tracking reflector, and a Doppler navigation experiment.   Its  objective  was  to obtain worldwide observations of total  electron  content  between  the  spacecraft and the earth.  The satellite was initially spin-stabilized, but it was despun after solar paddle erection.  Subsequent stabilization oriented the satellite axis of  symmetry  with  the  local magnetic field by means of a strong bar magnet  and  damping  rods.  A three-axis magnetometer and sun sensors provided  information  on the satellite attitude and spin rate.  There was  no  tape  recorder  aboard so that satellite performance data and electrostatic probe data could be observed only when the satellite was within  range  of a ground telemetry station.  Continuous transmitters also  operated  at  162  and  324  MHz  to  permit precise tracking by 'Transit'  tracking  stations for navigation and geodetic studies.  In August  1968,  data  acquisition from the satellite telemetry channels was  discontinued.   In  July  1969, tracking and world map production were  discontinued  by  GSFC,  and world map production based on NORAD orbit elements was subsequently assumed by ESRO.  The satellite failed in  February  1970  and  BE-C  was  turned  on  in order to  partially replace use made of this satellite beacon experiment.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Dynamics Explorer (DE) mission's general objective is to investigate the strong interactive processes coupling the hot, tenuous, convecting plasmas of the magnetosphere and the cooler, denser plasmas and gases corotating in the earth's ionosphere, upper atmosphere, and plasmasphere. Two satellites, DE 1 and DE 2, were launched together and were placed in polar coplanar orbits, permitting simultaneous measurements at high and low altitudes in the same field-line region. The DE 1 spacecraft (high-altitude mission) uses an elliptical orbit selected to allow (1) measurements extending from the hot magnetospheric plasma through the plasmasphere to the cool ionosphere; (2) global auroral imaging, wave measurements in the heart of the magnetosphere, and crossing of auroral field lines at several earth radii; and (3) measurements for significant periods along a magnetic field flux tube. The spacecraft approximated a short polygon 137 cm in diameter and 115 cm high. The antennas in the X-Y plane measured 200-m tip-to-tip, and on the Z-axis are 9 meters tip-to-tip. Two six-meter booms are provided for remote measurements. Power is supplied by a solar cell array, mounted on the side and end panels. The spacecraft is spin stabilized, with the spin axis normal to the orbital plane, and the spin rate at ten plus or minus 0.1 rpm. A pulse code modulation (PCM) telemetry data system is used that operates in real time or in a tape-recorder mode. Data have been acquired on a science-problem-oriented basis, with closely coordinated operations of the various instruments, both satellites, and supportive experiments. Data acquired from the instruments are temporarily stored on tape recorders before transmission at an 8:1 playback-to-record ratio. Additional operational flexibility allows a playback-to-record ratio of 4:1. The primary data rate is 16,384 bits per second. Since commands are stored in a command memory unit, spacecraft operations are not real time, except for the transmission of the wideband analog data from the Plasma Wave Instrument (81-070A-02). On October 22, 1990 science operations were terminated. On February 28, 1991 Dynamics Explorer 1 operations were offically terminated.

DMSP 5D-2/F7 was one of a series of meteorological satellites developed and operated by the Air Force under the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). This program, previously known as DAPP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objective of this program was to provide global visual and infrared cloudcover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense requirements. Operationally, the program consisted of two satellites in planned 830-km, sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other one at local noon. The 6.4-m-long spacecraft was divided into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform for sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment; (2) an equipment support module containing the electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors; (3) a reaction control equipment support structure containing the third-stage rocket motor and supporting the ascent phase reaction control equipment; and (4) a 9.29-sq-m solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization was controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system so sensors were maintained in the desired "earth-looking" mode. One feature was the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allowed automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element. The operational linescan system was the primary data acquisition system that provided real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night, visual and infrared imagery of the clouds. A supplementary sensor package contained six special sensors: (1) a microwave temperature sounder, (2) an X-ray spectrometer, (3) an ionospheric plasma monitor, (4) a precipitating electron/ion spectrometer, (5) a magnetometer, and (6) a space radiation dosimeter. Either recorded or real-time data were transmitted to ground-receiving sites by two redundant S-band transmitters. Recorded data were read out to tracking sites located at Fairchild AFB, Washington, and at Loring AFB, Maine, and relayed by SATCOM to Air Force Global Weather Central, Offutt AFB, Nebraska. Real-time data were read out at mobile tactical sites located around the world. A more complete description of the satellite can be found in the report by D. A. Nichols, "The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program," Optical Engineering, v. 14, n. 4, July-August 1975.

Due to the success of CBERS-1 and 2, the two governments decided, in November 2002, to give continuity to the CBERS program by signing a new agreement for the development and launch of two more satellites, CBERS-3 and 4.

Brazilian participation in this program will be enlarged up to 50%, thus taking Brazil to a condition of equality with its partner. CBERS-3 is expected to be launched in 2009, CBERS-4 in 2011.

CBERS-3 and 4 satellites represent an evolution of CBERS-1 and 2. Four cameras will be present in the payload module, with improved geometrical and radiometric performance.

They are: PanMux Camera-PANMUX, Multi-spectral Camera-MUXCAM, Scanning Medium Resolution Scanner-IRSCAM and Wide Field Imaging Camera-WFICAM.

The orbits of the two satellites will be the same as for CBERS-1 and 2.

[Source: NASA Press Release 11-050, http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2011/mar/HQ_11-050_N0_Glory.html ] 

WASHINGTON -- NASA's Glory mission launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California Friday at 5:09:45 a.m. EST failed to reach orbit. 

Telemetry indicated the fairing, the protective shell atop the Taurus XL rocket, did not separate as expected about three minutes after launch.

Glory is a remote-sensing Earth-orbiting observatory designed to achieve two separate mission objectives. One is to collect data on the chemical, microphysical, and optical properties, and spatial and temporal distributions of aerosols. The other is to continue collection of total solar irradiance data for the long-term climate record.

The Glory mission's scientific objectives are met by implementing two separate science instruments, one with the ability to collect polarimetric measurements along the satellite ground track within the solar reflective spectral region (0.4 to 2.4 micrometers) and one with the ability to monitor changes in sunlight incident on the Earth's atmosphere by collecting high accuracy, high precision measurements of total solar irradiance. Glory accomplishes these objectives by deploying two instruments aboard a low earth orbit satellite, the Aerosol Polarimetry Sensor (APS) and the Total Irradiance Monitor (TIM). Additionally, a cloud camera system will provide images that allow the APS scans along the spacecraft ground track to be put into spatial context and to facilitate determination of cloud occurrence within the APS instantaneous field of view.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">GOES satellites provide the kind of continuous monitoring necessary
for intensive data analysis. They circle the Earth in a geosynchronous
orbit, which means they orbit the equatorial plane of the Earth at a
speed matching the Earth's rotation. This allows them to hover
continuously over one position on the surface. The geosynchronous
plane is about 35,800 km (22,300 miles) above the Earth, high enough
to allow the satellites a full-disc view of the Earth. Because they
stay above a fixed spot on the surface, they provide a constant vigil
for the atmospheric "triggers" for severe weather conditions such as
tornadoes, flash floods, hail storms, and hurricanes. When these
conditions develop the GOES satellites are able to monitor storm
development and track their movements.

GOES satellite imagery is also used to estimate rainfall during the
thunderstorms and hurricanes for flash flood warnings, as well as
estimates snowfall accumulations and overall extent of snow
cover. Such data help meteorologists issue winter storm warnings and
spring snow melt advisories. Satellite sensors also detect ice fields
and map the movements of sea and lake ice.

NASA launched the first GOES for NOAA in 1975 and followed it with
another in 1977. Currently, the United States is operating GOES-10 and
GOES-12. (GOES-9, which is partially operational, is being provided to
the Japanese Meteorological Agency to replace their failing
geostationary satellite.) GOES-11 is being stored in orbit as a
replacement for GOES-12 or GOES-10 in the event of failure.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (GRO) was the second of NASA's
Great Observatories. Compton, at 17 tons, was the heaviest
astrophysical payload ever flown at the time of its launch on
April 5, 1991 aboard the space shuttle Atlantis. Compton was
safely deorbited and re-entered the Earth's atmosphere on June
4, 2000.

The objective of the Compton GRO was to make comprehensive
observations of gamma ray sources throughout the Universe. The
observatory carried four scientific instruments that made gamma
ray energy measurements from 0.1 million electron volts to
30,000 million electron volts.

The end of life was in June 2000. The failure of 1 gyroscope
requires the deorbitation of the satellite in order to make sure
it will not fall in a populated area. It is too large to
completely burn in the atmosphere.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Direct Measurement Explorer-A (DME-A) satellite was launched in November 1965 into a near-earth orbit ranging between altitudes of 500 and 3000 km to sample and measure charged particles. The attitude control system is used to keep the spin axis aligned with the orbit normal and to maintain the spin rate. Spin axis control is achieved by a chargeable permanent magnet system which is operated upon command and reacts with the earth's field to produce precession of several degrees per minute. With this system the spin axis was kept within 10 degrees of the orbit normal for several weeks at a time, although larger deviations have been tolerated. The spin rate was observed to decay at 0.05 rpm per day. Periodic use of the spin rate control system has compensated for spin decay. This system is analogous to a DC motor in which the entire satellite is the armature.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Tsinghua-1 is a microsatellite of Tsinghua University, developed and built in a joint venture between SSTL of Guildford, Surrey, UK, and Tsinghua University in Beijing, China. The TSRC (Tsinghua Space Research Center) was set up in Oct. 1998 with the goal to integrate all space research activities at Tsinghua University and to provide a means and facilities for S/C building. The joint-venture company in Beijing is referred to as T-SSSC (Tsinghua-Surrey Small Satellite Company). The cooperative program is to develop and build microsatellites (Tsinghua-1) and nanosatellites (THNS-1) and to provide integrated training in small satellite design.

Tsinghua-1 (also referred to as "Hangtian" in Chinese) is a demonstrator microsatellite in the 50 kg class of size: 35 cm x 35 cm x 64 cm. The overall objective is to provide daily high-resolution imaging for disaster monitoring and mitigation on a worldwide scale. A further goal of Tsinghua-1 is to conduct communications research in LEO. The design uses the new MicroSat-70 platform modules or trays to carry the subsystems and payload. The power subsystem design includes the regulation, protection and distribution of a 35 W solar array and 7 Ah NiCd batteries. This subsystem essentially offers two buses: an unregulated 14 V bus and a regulated 5 V bus. The three payload modules include the GPS receiver (SGR-10 with 12 channels), transputer, and DSP/DTE (Digital Signal Processing/Data Transfer Experiment) unit. The three cameras and 3 reaction wheels are accommodated in the Earth Observation Compartment. Two GPS antennas are accommodated on the space facing side of the S/C.

The spacecraft is three-axis stabilized using a combination of passive (gravity-gradient boom) and active (magnetorquers, reaction wheels) actuator elements. The platform is nadir pointing. Attitude is sensed by sun sensors and a magnetometer. The body-pointing platform has the capability to perform fast slew maneuvers within 15 about the roll axis (or 180 about the yaw axis). An off-nadir pointing configuration can be sustained for up to half an orbit. Onboard data handling is provided with a dual CAN (Controller Area Network) bus (ISO 11898 &amp; ISO 11519-1) 20 Mbit/s, and INMOS serial point-to-point link 9.6 kbit/s asynchronous duplex UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter).

A launch of Tsinghua-1, along with SNAP-1 of SSTL as secondary payloads to Nadezhda-6, the prime Russian S&amp;RSAT (Search &amp; Rescue Satellite) of COSPAS, took place on June 28, 2000 on a Russian Cosmos-3M launcher from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome, Russia.

Orbit: Sun-synchronous circular orbit, altitude = 700 km, inclination = 98, period of 100 minutes.

Status of Tsinghua-1 mission: The spacecraft is operational as of 2004. 

Sensor complement:

MEIS (Multispectral Earth Imaging System).MEIS is a demonstrator instrument intended for the upcoming DMC (Disaster Monitoring Constellation) mission. The objective is to acquire multispectral Earth surface imagery with a spatial resolution of 40 m (snapshot imagery). The MEIS camera assembly consists of three cameras (one for each spectral band) mounted at an angle of 15 from nadir so that the yaw angle can be selected to offer the required off-pointing angle of 15 from nadir. The image swath width is 80 km and each camera can collect four images contiguously along the flight path. The instrument performs autonomous onboard histogram analysis to ensure optimum image quality involving image processing, compression and onboard storage. The OBCs may also be used to carry out autonomous onboard cloud editing and high-compression thumb-nail image previews.

SGR-10 (Space GPS Receiver-10). The objective is real-time positioning for tracking the satellite and providing orbital elements for the spacecraft mission and ground station. SGR is a customized COTS-developed receiver. The instrument is based on the second generation GPS chip set of MITEL Semiconductors. The SGR consists of the following elements: GPS antennas, LNAs, the RF section, the digital section and the TLM/TC node. 

RF section: The SGR has two separate RF front-ends in the RF section which are responsible for down-converting the GPS signals and digitizing the IF signals. The RF sections use the same local oscillator so that the measurements are referenced to the same fundamental TCXO clock.

Digital section: This part consists of hardware correlator channels, memory, a 32 bit RISC microprocessor with supporting peripherals and the interface circuitry. There are 24 C/A code correlation channels available, although only 12 channels are available if only 2 antennas are used.

TLM/TC node: A separate 8 bit microcontroller is used to provide telemetry and telecommands. The telemetry includes status monitoring of SGR, while telecommand include reset, power down parts of the receiver, some redundancy switching etc.

The SGR-10 receives the L1 signal from the GPS constellation. The total SGR mass is 1.355 kg, including antenna/LNA. The accuracy of positioning, velocity and time synchronization (under Selective Availability on GPS) are: 150 m, 1 m/s, 3-D, 2 sigma approximately, and + 1 s, respectively.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The SENTINEL-1 mission is the European Radar Observatory for the Copernicus joint initiative of the European Commission (EC) and the European Space Agency (ESA). Copernicus, previously known as GMES, is a European initiative for the implementation of information services dealing with environment and security. It is based on observation data received from Earth Observation satellites and ground-based information.

The SENTINEL-1 mission includes C-band imaging operating in four exclusive imaging modes with different resolution (down to 5 m) and coverage (up to 400 km). It provides dual polarisation capability, very short revisit times and rapid product delivery. For each observation, precise measurements of spacecraft position and attitude are available.

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has the advantage of operating at wavelengths not impeded by cloud cover or a lack of illumination and can acquire data over a site during day or night time under all weather conditions. SENTINEL-1, with its C-SAR instrument, can offer reliable, repeated wide area monitoring.

The mission is composed of a constellation of two satellites, SENTINEL-1A and SENTINEL-1B, sharing the same orbital plane.

SENTINEL-1 is designed to work in a pre-programmed, conflict-free operation mode, imaging all global landmasses, coastal zones and shipping routes at high resolution and covering the global ocean with vignettes. This ensures the reliability of service required by operational services and a consistent long term data archive built for applications based on long time series.

DMSD 5D-1/F3 was one of a series of meteorological satellites developed and operated by the Air Force under the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). This program, previously known as DAPP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objectives of this program were to provide global visual and infrared cloudcover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense requirements. Operationally, the program consisted of two satellites in sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other at local noon. The 5.4-m-long spacecraft was separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform (PMP) for sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment; (2) an equipment support module (ESM) containing the electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors; (3) a reaction control equipment (RCE) support structure (including the third-stage motor and hydrazine reaction control system); and (4) a 9.29-sq-m solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization was controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system so sensors could be maintained in the desired "earth-looking" mode. One feature was the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allowed automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element. The operational linescan system (OLS), built by Westinghouse, was the primary data acquisition system that provided real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night visual and infrared imagery of clouds, and provided with the data calibration, timing, and other auxiliary signals to the spacecraft for digital transmission to the ground. A supplementary meterological sensor, the special sensor H (SSH), a step-scanning radiometer, was the infrared temperature-humidity-ozone sounder. Either recorded or real-time data were transmitted to ground-receiving sites by two redundant S-band transmitters. Recorded data were read out to tracking sites located at Fairchild AFB, Wash., and Loring AFB, Maine, and relayed by SATCOM to Air Force Global Weather Central, Offutt AFB, Nebraska. Real-time data were read out at mobile tactical sites located around the world. A more complete description of the satellite can be found in the report, D. A. Nichols, "The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program," Optical Engineering, v. 14, n. 4, July-August 1975.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">NOAA-7 was launched in June 1981 and was a third generation
operational meteorological satellite for use in the National
Operational Environmental Satellite System (NOESS) and for the support
of the Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP) during 1978-84.  The
satellite design provided an economical and stable sun-synchronous
platform for advanced operational instruments to measure the earth's
atmosphere, its surface and cloud cover, and the near-space
environment.  The satellite was based upon the Block 5D spacecraft bus
developed for the U.S. Air Force, and it was capable of maintaining an
earth-pointing accuracy of better than plus or minus 0.1 degree with a
motion rate of less than 0.035 degree/second.
Primary sensors included an Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
(AVHRR) and a TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS). Secondary
experiments consisted of a Space Environment Monitor (SEM) and a Data
Collection and Platform Location System (DCPLS).  A contamination
monitor was provided by the U.S. Air Force to assess contamination
sources, levels, and effects for consideration on future spacecraft.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The first European Remote Sensing Satellite ERS-1, launched on 17 July
1991 at 01.46 UTC, operates in a sun-synchronous, near-polar orbit at
an altitude of 785 km and an inclination of 98.5 degrees, known as the
reference orbit.

ERS-1 was conceived as an orbiting platform that would be capable of
measuring, on a global scale, the Earth's atmospheric and surface
properties with a high degree of accuracy. In fact it uses advanced
microwave techniques to collect global measurements and images (much
of the data are collected from remote areas such as the southern
oceans and the Antarctic) independently of time of day and weather
conditions. It also undertakes the measurement of many parameters that
are not covered by existing satellite systems, including those of sea
state, sea surface winds, ocean circulation and sea/ice levels.

Power supply: 4 x 24 Ah batteries; 1.8 kW from solar array
Attitude control:  3-axis stabilised earth pointing, with
option of 9.5 degrees offset in Roll-Tilt Mode (RTM)

ERS-1 carries on-board a number of instruments consisting of a core
set of active microwave sensors supported by additional, complementary
instruments: the Active Microwave Instrument (AMI), which combines a
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) operating in image or wave mode and a
wind scatterometer, the Radar Altimeter (RA), the Along-Track Scanning
Radiometer and Microwave Sounder (ATSR), the Precise Range and
Range-rate Equipment (PRARE) and Laser Retroreflectors (LRR).

The primary objective of the ERS-1 mission is the monitoring of oceans
and sea ice providing essential data for:

- improved representation of oceans/atmosphere interactions
in climatic models
- major advances in the knowledge of ocean circulation and
transfer of energy
- more reliable estimates of the mass balance of the Arctic
and Antarctic ice sheets
- better monitoring of pollution and dynamic coastal
processes
- improved detection and management of land use change


The ability of ERS-1 to acquire vast global data sets of ocean,
atmosphere, ice and land phenomena contributes to the following fields
of study:


- Ocean/Ice: ocean circulation, global wind/wave
relationships, sea ice and iceberg monitoring, etc.
- Physical Earth: accurate determination of the ocean
geoid, forestry, glaciology, geology and agriculture
studies, etc.
- Climate: contribution to the World Climate Research
Programme and to the World Ocean Circulation Experiment
- Weather and Sea: short and medium-term weather
forecasting, sea surface state forecasting, wind speed and
direction, location of pelagic fish through the monitoring
of temperature fronts

( ) indicates limited applicability

(1) For large-scale circulation, accurate orbit
determination over short arcs is required

(2) For solar tides, measurements from other satellites in
complementary orbits are required

(3) The altimeter and active microwave instrumentation are
mutually supportive in deriving the wind and wave fields

The complexity of the ERS-1 mission, which effectively consists of a
combination of several different missions, requires a very careful
approach when planning the mission operations. Taking into account the
different mission objectives, and attempting to satisfy them in a
quasi-optimal way in the course of ERS-1's lifetime, has held to the
definition of phases of activity during the mission:


- Phase 0: Orbit acquisition, initial switch-on and
functional check-out (2 weeks after the launch)
- Phase A: The Commisioning phase, using a 3 day repeat
cycle (25 July 1991-10 December 1991)
- Phase B : The first ice phase, using a 3 day repeat cycle
 (28 December 1991-1 April 1992)
- Phase R: The Roll-Tilt phase, using a 35 day repeat cycle
 (2 April 1992-14 April 1992)
- Phase C: The first multi-disciplinary phase, using a 35
day repeat cycle
 (14 April 1992-23 December 1993)
- Phase D: The second ice phase, using a 3 day repeat cycle
 (23 December 1993-10 April 1994)
- Phase E: The first geodetic phase, using a 172 day repeat
cycle
 (10 April 1994-28 September 1994)
- Phase F: The second Geodetic Phase, using a 172 day
repeat cycle
 (28 September 1994-21 March 1995)
- Phase G: The second Multi-Disciplinary Phase, using a 35
day repeat cycle
 (21 March 1995-10 March 2000)

In the first half of April 1992, the satellite was operated in a
Roll-tilt-mode (RTM) to allow SAR imaging at a different view
angle. In fact by rotating the satellite body around its velocity
vector (so-called 'Roll-tilt mode') the angle at which all the
instruments look at the Earth can be varied. This allows
experimentation with the SAR at an incidence angle of 35 degrees
instead of the standard 23 degrees, thereby permitting analysis of a
totally different set of signatures from objects on the Earth's
surface, including in particular vegetation.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">EROS-B is a high-resolution commercial imaging minisatellite mission of ImageSat International N.V. headquartered in the Netherlands Antilles (Cayman Islands), with offices in Limassol, Cyprus, and in Tel Aviv, Israel. The overall objective is to provide high-resolution imagery to the customer base.

Spacecraft:

The EROS-B series S/C structure is identical to that of EROS-A, based on the Ofeq platform of Israel's Defense Ministry, and designed and built by Israel Aircraft Industries Ltd. (IAI/MBT). The deployed S/C structure is 2.3 m high and 4.0 m wide. The S/C is is 3-axis stabilized and the light/rigid design of the EROS satellite family allows for a great degree of platform agility. The spacecraft is very agile, a body-pointing capability of ±45º from nadir is provided in all directions, supporting the daily data acquisition plan. The S/C attitude is sensed and controlled as done with EROS-A. In addition, there is a star sensor for the B satellite series. The nominal S/C design life is six years.

The nominal S/C launch mass is ~290 kg; however, additional onboard fuel (up to 60 kg) is sufficient for S/C operations of up to 10 years. This increased the spacecraft launch mass to about 350 kg. 

Orbit: Sun-synchronous circular orbit, mean altitude = 500 km, inclination = 97.4º, local time of descending node (LTDN) at 14:00 hours. - Note: The orbits of EROS-A and EROS-B are phased in the same orbital plane thereby increasing the revisit time of the constellation.

Launch: A launch of EROS-B took place on April 25, 2006 on a Start-1 launch vehicle from the Svobodny Cosmodrome in eastern Siberia (location at: 51.4º N, 128.3º E). 3)

RF communications: Imagery is transmitted in X-band at a rate of 280 Mbit/s (downlink) to the ground receiving stations, using a 1.5 W transmitter and one of the two existing two-axis gimbaled directional antennas. The EROS satellites are monitored/operated in S-Band (TT&amp;C) via a single ground control station (GCS), located at IAI/MBT in Israel (3 to 4 passes per day and per satellite are in station visibility). The S-band data rate is either 2.5 or 15 kbit/s selectable by the GCS.

ImageSat has a global network of ground segment infrastructure, for real-time image data acquisition. This network is comprised of the ImageSat Central Ground Control Station, a network of EROS-compatible Ground Receiving Stations on 5 continents and EROS-compatible Ground Control Stations based at exclusive customers' premises. 

Sensor complement: (PIC-2)

PIC-2 (Panchromatic Imaging Camera-2), designed and developed by ElOp (Electro Optical Industries) of Rehovot, Israel, a subsidiary of Elbit Systems Ltd. The EROS-B series imager instrument features CCD pushbroom technology in combination with a TDI (Time Delay Integration) scheme in its focal plane, a cumulative expose concept of each ground image line by a CCD detector array, to improve the SNR value (an important issue for high-resolution imaging). The instrument uses also a Cassegrain telescope with an aperture of 50 cm in diameter and a focal length of 5 m (folded optics). FOV = 1.5º. The PIC-2 instrument is rigidly mounted to the S/C structure looking into the nadir direction, thus permitting a body-pointing observation scheme. 

he CCD pushbroom detector array provides 10,000 pixels per line and a total of 96 lines for selectable TDI observation support. Pushbroom scanning is provided for panchromatic imagery only in the spectral range of 0.5 - 0.9 μm. The ground sampling distance (GSD) is 0.70 m, the swath width is 7 km at nadir. The data is quantized at 10 bit/sample.

The imager instrument of EROS-B spacecraft can be operated in either asynchronous or in synchronous imaging mode. In synchronous mode, the S/C platform keeps a constant pointing angle toward the Earth's surface. In asynchronous mode, imaging by the detector array is performed in a "step-and-stare" fashion, i.e., by slewing the S/C platform in the along-track direction (this permits in particular the generation of mosaics as well as the support of stereo imaging of targets of interest).

DMSP 5D-2/F14, also named USA 131, is one of a series of meteorological satellites developed and operated by the Air Force under the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). This program, previously known as DAPP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objective of this program is to provide global visual and infrared cloudcover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense operational weather analysis and forecasting requirements. Operationally, the program consists of two satellites in sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other at local noon.

The 6.4-m-long spacecraft is separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform for sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment; (2) an equipment support module containing the electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors; (3) a reaction control equipment support structure containing the third-stage rocket motor and supporting the ascent phase reaction control equipment; and (4) a 9.29-sq-m solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization is controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system so that sensors are maintained in the desired earth-looking mode. One feature is the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allows automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element.

The operational linescan system is the primary data acquisition system and provides real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night, visual and infrared imagery of clouds. A supplementary sensor package contains: (1) a microwave imager; (2) a microwave temperature sounder; (3) a microwave water vapor profiler; (4) an ion and electron scintillation monitor; (5) a precipitating electron/ion spectrometer; (6) a gamma/X-ray detector; (7) a magnetometer; and (8) a static earth-viewing sensor monitoring electromagnetic radiation.

Additional information concerning the satellite can be found in the report by D. A. Nichols, "The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program," Optical Engineering, v. 14, n. 4, p. 273, July-August 1975.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">NOAA 14 (National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration) Weather Satellite:

Objectives:

To continue the Advanced TIROS-N program by working as a
companion with NOAA-10, 11 and 12 in order to provide continuous
coverage of the Earth and to provide high-resolution global
meteorological data.

NOAA-14 is the sixth operational satellite in the Advanced
TIROS-N series (NOAA 13 never officially became operational as
it failed during its 21 day checkout period). The satellite
carried the AVHRR, TOVS, and the solar proton monitor. All of
which were present on previous NOAA satellites. The ERBE
instruments, the SBUV radiometer and the SARSAT systems were
also flown on this satellite. NOAA-14 was placed in a near
circular, (470nm) polar orbit.

NOAA 14 replaced NOAA 11 whose cloud cover imaging instrument
had failed a few months before this launch. Besides an imaging
radiometer, it carries optical sounders to monitor temperature
and moisture content in the atmosphere, and counters to measure
energetic electrons and protons.

A gas leak caused some difficulties in attitude control shortly
after launch, but this has been resolved. The motor for the
Microwave Sounding Unit on the NOAA 14 spacecraft has stopped
working. Records show the unit is from a delivery made to Martin
Marietta dating back to 1984! The microwave sounder returned to
normal operation in May 1995 after a software patch was
installed to cope with any repeat failure. Its life expectancy
remains uncertain.

In Feb 1995, the SARP failed, the SBUV/2 Cloud Cover Radiometer
(CCR) failed, and DTR 4A/B was deemed inoperable.

The compartment and platform were flown into space and returned inside the payload compartment of the Space Shuttle.  The mission lasted 10 days, and while in space, the Shuttle payload compartment doors were opened to allow viewing of the earth, sun, and deep space.  Spacelab 1 was a multidiscipline mission comprising five broad areas of investigation: Atmospheric Physics and Earth Observations, Space Plasma Physics, Astronomy and Solar Physics, Material Sciences and Technology, and Life Sciences.  The Atmospheric Physics investigations conducted studies of the earth's environment through surveys of temperature, composition, and motion of the atmosphere.  The Earth Observations investigations used and evaluated the capability of advanced measuring systems for making topographic and thematic maps from high-resolution photographs and from remote-sensing data.  Investigations in the Space Plasma Physics group studied the charged particle or plasma environment of the earth.  The Astronomy investigations studied astronomical sources of radiation in the ultraviolet and X-ray wavelengths.  The Solar Physics investigations measured the total energy output of the sun using three different methods with the instruments cross calibrated so that meaningful comparisons could be made.  The Material Sciences and Technology investigations took advantage of the microgravity conditions to perform studies in such areas as crystal growth, metallurgy, tribology, fluid physics, and ceramics technology.  The Life Sciences investigations were concerned with the effects of the space environment (zero gravity and high-energy radiation) on human physiology and on the growth, development, and organization of biological systems.  The mission was considered very successful.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Indian Remote Sensing Satellite-1A (IRS-1A) was launched on March 17, 1988.  IRS-1A is the first of a series of semi-operational/ operational remote sensing satellites developed by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) for land-based applications such as agriculture,forestry, geology, and hydrology.  The three-axis-stabilized sun-synchronous satellite carries two linear imaging self-scanned sensors (LISS). LISS-1 and LISS-II perform "pushbroom" scanning in visible and near IR bands to acquire images of the earth.  Both push-broom scanning sensors operate in the four spectral bands: 0.45-0.52, 0.52-0.59, 0.62-0.68, and 0.77-0.86 micrometer.  Local equatorial crossing time is fixed at around 10 a.m.  The spacecraft platform, measuring 1.56 m x 1.66 m x 1.10 m, has the payload module attached on the top and a deployable solar array stowed on either side.  Attitude control is provided by four momentum wheels, two magnetic torques, and a thruster system. Together these mechanisms provide an estimated accuracy of plus or minus 0.10 deg in all three axes.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Weather Stations are facilities or locations where meteorological data
are gathered, recorded, and released. Such stations are of the
first order when they make observations of all the important
elements either hourly or by self-registering instruments; of the
second order when only important observations are taken; of the
third order when simpler work is done, as to record rainfall and
maximum and minimum temperatures.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">   The world's first operational weather satellite system was placed into
service with the launching of the Environmental Satellite Services
Administration (which in 1970 became the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, NOAA) satellites, ESSA-1, on February 3, 1966, and ESSA-2, on
February 28, 1966.  The objective of this program, called the TIROS Operational
System (TOS), was to acquire global observational data routinely on a daily
basis.  This system consisted of a pair of ESSA satellites in sun synchronous
(polar) orbit.  The odd numbered satellites (ESSA-1, 3, 5, 7, and 9) utilized
the Advanced Vidicon Camera System (AVCS) to obtain global imagery which were
transmitted to the ESSA Command and Data Acquisition (CDA) stations at Wallops,
Virginia, and Fairbanks, Alaska.  The CDA stations relayed the data to
the National Environmental Satellite Service (NESS), which later became the
National Environmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service (NESDIS),
located in Suitland, Maryland, for processing and distribution to forecasting
centers of the U.S. and other nations.  The even numbered satellites (ESSA-2,
4, 6, and 8) were equipped with Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) TV cameras
which transmitted television pictures directly to ground stations worldwide.
The ESSA satellites operated in orbits at altitudes of approximately 1450 km.
     The second generation operational polar orbiting satellites started with
the ITOS-1 (Improved TIROS Operational System) mission launched on January 23,
1970 which combined the joint capabilities of two ESSA spacecraft; essentially,
the direct readout APT system and the global stored images of the AVCS.  The
second generation objectives were to provide improved operational Infrared
(IR) and Visible (VIS) observations of Earth cloud cover for use in weather
analysis and forecasting and also to provide solar proton and global heat data
on a daily basis.  ITOS-1 also carried an operational 2 channel Scanning
Radiometer (SR) providing day and night radiometric data for immediate
transmission as well as acquisition data stored for delayed transmission to CDA
stations.  With an Infrared 5 channel scanner, global observation of the Earth
atmosphere and surface areas was available once every 12 hours.  A second ITOS
spacecraft, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellite,
NOAA-1, was launched on December 11, 1970.
     The ITOS system evolved further with the development of the ITOS-D
satellites, NOAA-2, 3, 4, and 5 and were placed into orbit in 1972, 1973, 1974,
and 1975, respectively.  These had a new sensor complement to provide day and
night imaging by means of the Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR) along with
the medium resolution Scanning Radiometer (SR).  The Vertical Temperature
Profile Radiometer (VTPR) for sounding the atmosphere and the Solar Proton
Monitor (SPM) for measurements of solar proton and electron flux in the
vicinity of the satellite were added.
     The first spacecraft in the third generation operational polar orbiting
environmental satellite system was TIROS-N which was launched in 1978.  The
third generation objectives were to provide observations for the atmosphere,
cloud cover, surface and near-surface.  The TIROS-N type satellites that
followed were NOAA-A (6), NOAA-B which failed to achieve useful orbit, NOAA-C
(7), and NOAA-D.  The TIROS-N system provided NOAA with the global
meteorological and environmental data required for normal operations and for
the experimental World Weather Watch (WWW) Program.  The spacecraft had a new
complement of data gathering instruments.  The Advanced Very High Resolution
Radiometer (AVHRR) provided day and night imaging in the Visible (VIS) and
Infrared (IR), sea surface temperature (SST) determination, estimation of heat
budget components, and identification of snow and sea ice.  The TIROS
Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS) supplied improved estimates of the vertical
structure of the atmosphere.  The Data Collection System (DCS) gathered
environmental data from fixed and moving platforms such as buoys and
balloons, and transmitted the data to central stations for processing and
relay to users.  The Solar Environment Monitor (SEM) measured solar proton,
electron, and alpha particle densities.  The data collected were stored onboard
the satellite for transmission to the NOAA central processing facility at
Suitland, Maryland, through the Wallops and Fairbanks CDA stations.  Satellite
data also were transmitted in real time direct readout at VHF and S-band
frequencies to remote stations worldwide.
     The Advanced TIROS-N (ATN) type satellites were NOAA-E (8), NOAA-F (9),
NOAA-G (10), NOAA-H (11), NOAA-I (12), and NOAA-J (13), the latter two
scheduled for launch in 1990 and 1991 respectively.  The spacecraft was
lengthened 0.5m and the solar array was enlarged to provide additional power.
New systems were added starting with NOAA-8: the Search and Rescue (SAR)
system; NOAA-9: the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) instruments and
the Solar Backscatter UltraViolet (SBUV) radiometer; NOAA-10: ERBE instruments.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">A variety of scientific questions will be addressed when NASA conducts Shuttle mission STS-56 in late March 1993.  The crew on Space Shuttle Discovery will gather data on the relationship between sun's energy output and Earth's middle-atmosphere chemical make-up and how these factors affect the Earth's ozone level.

The crew will use the Atmospheric Laboratory for Science and Applications (ATLAS 2) and Shuttle Backscatter Ultraviolet (SSBUV) payloads aboard Discovery to gather this information.

The source of solar wind and the possible applications a microgravity environment can provide for research in drug development and the changes which occur in muscles and bones in a weightless condition are some of the other areas to be investigated during the STS-56 mission.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The satellites of the SCD (Satelites de Coleta de Dados) series
are equipped to collect and transmit meteorological and
environmental data collected by automatic platforms (PCD)
installed on land or on oceanic buoys. The data is relayed to
one or more ground stations.  The INPE is responsible for
development, production and operation of this series of 4
satellites, the SCD-1, SCD-2, SCD-2A and SCD-3.  SCD-1 was
placed in orbit in February 1993 by a Pegasus and is operating
until today, with a useful life beyond the period, initially
foreseen, of one year. The SCD-2 was launched successfully in
1998, by a Pegasus-H vehicle, from Cape Canaveral. Currently it
operates jointly form with SCD-1. The SCD-2A was lost in the
inaugural launching of the VLS-1, in 1997. SCD 3 is a new
design, which will be launched into a higher orbit to enlarge
the area covered by the satellite.

The SPOT-B (Systeme Probatoire d'Observation de la Terre) spacecraft is an earth observation satellite with a ground resolution better than that of the Landsat series satellites. The main applications for the images returned by the second SPOT mission are land-use studies, agriculture and forestry resources, mineral and oil resources, and cartography. The three-axis stabilized satellite operates in a circular sun-synchronous near-polar orbit for a design lifetime of 2 years. The spacecraft dimensions are 2 x 2 x 3.5 m and 15.60 m for the overall length of the deployed solar panel. SPOT-B consists of two parts: (1) the bus, a standard multipurpose platform, and (2) the payload. The bus provides housekeeping information and an onboard computer. The payload is mounted on one of the side panels of the bus. It consists of two identical high-resolution visible (HRV) imaging instruments and a package comprising two magnetic-tape data recorders and a telemetry transmitter. The HRV imaging instrument observes in three spectral bands (in the visible and near infrared regions) with a ground resolution of 20 m, and/or in a broader spectral band (panchromatic black and white) with a ground resolution of 10 m. The pattern of successive ground tracks is repeated exactly at 26-day intervals. The SPOT-B instrument package has the provision for off-nadir viewing which should be particularly useful for monitoring localized phenomena evolving on a relatively short timescale. It also provides the capability for recording stereoscopic pairs of images of a given area during successive satellite passes.

  The  GEOS  1  (Geodetic  Earth  Orbiting  Satellite)  spacecraft was a
  gravity-gradient-stabilized,    solar-cell   powered   unit   designed
  exclusively  for geodetic studies.  It was the first successful active
  spacecraft    of    the    National    Geodetic   Satellite   Program.
  Instrumentation   included   (1)   four  optical  beacons,  (2)  laser
  reflectors,  (3)  a  radio range transponder, (4) Doppler beacons, and
  (5)  a  range  and  range  rate  transponder.   These were designed to
  operate   simultaneously   to   fulfill  the  objectives  of  locating
  observation  points (geodetic control stations) in a three dimensional
  earth  center-of-mass  coordinate  system  within 10 m of accuracy, of
  defining  the  structure  of the earth's irregular gravitational field
  and  refining  the  locations  and  magnitudes  of  the  large gravity
  anomalies, and of comparing results of the various systems onboard the
  spacecraft  to  determine  the  most  accurate  and  reliable  system.
  Acquisition  and recording of data were the responsibility of the GSFC
  Space  Tracking  and  Data  Acquisitions  Network (STADAN).  Ten major
  observing networks were used.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Following the deployment of the Goddard Space Flight Center's (GSFC) Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS) on Sept. 15, 1991, from the Space Shuttle Discovery, scientists have gained a better understanding of the energy input, chemistry and dynamics of the upper atmosphere and the coupling between the upper and lower atmosphere. UARS, the first satellite dedicated to studying stratospheric science, focuses on the processes that lead to ozone depletion, complementing and amplifying the measurements of total ozone made by the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) onboard NASA's Nimbus-7 and the Russian Meteor-3 satellites. UARS also measures winds and temperatures in the stratosphere as well as the energy input from the Sun.  

Ten UARS instruments have provided the most complete data on upper atmospheric energy inputs, winds, and chemical composition ever gathered. Together, these observations constitute a highly integrated investigation of the nature of the upper atmosphere, and help define the role of the upper atmosphere in climate and climate variability. In its first two weeks of operation, UARS data confirmed the polar ozone-depletion theories by providing three-dimensional maps of ozone and chlorine monoxide near the South Pole during development of the 1991 ozone hole. UARS, developed and managed by GSFC, in Greenbelt, Md., provides information that nations around the world can use to guide decisions on environmental policies, according to scientists.  

Moreover, UARS collected data on the chemistry, dynamics, and radiative inputs to the upper atmosphere far beyond its designed lifetime, obtaining over 13 years of observations for many atmospheric constituents, temperature, winds, and external forcings.  UARS was decommissioned in 2005. The United Kingdom and Canada both provided instruments for this mission. UARS is the first spacecraft launched as part of NASA's systematic, comprehensive study of the Earth system.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Spacecraft Brief Description
  The  objectives  of  the  OSO  satellite  series were to perform solar
  physics experiments above the atmosphere during a complete solar cycle
  and  to map the entire celestial sphere for direction and intensity of
  UV  light and X-ray and gamma radiation.  The OSO 7 platform consisted
  of  a  sail  section, which pointed two experiments continually toward
  the  sun,  and a wheel section, which spun about an axis perpendicular
  to  the  pointing  direction of the sail and carried four experiments.
  Attitude  adjustment was performed by gas jets and a magnetic torquing
  coil.   A  pointing  control permitted the pointed experiments to scan
  the  region  of  the solar disk in a 60- by 60-arc-min raster pattern.
  In addition, the pointed section could be commanded to select and scan
  any  7.5-  by  5-arc-min  region  near  the  solar  disk.   Data  were
  simultaneously  recorded  on tape and transmitted by PCM/PM telemetry.
  A  command  system  provided  for  at least 155 ground-based commands.
  Only real-time data have been received since May 1973, when the second
  tape recorder failed.  The spacecraft reentered the earth's atmosphere
  July 9, 1974.

GOES-1 (SMS-C) was launched in October 1975 and was a NASA-developed, NOAA-operated, geosynchronous, and operational spacecraft.  The cylindrically shaped spacecraft measured 190.5 cm in diameter and 230 cm in length, exclusive of a magnetometer that extended an additional 83 cm beyond the cylinder shell.  The primary structural members were a honeycombed equipment shelf and thrust tube. The VISSR telescope was mounted on the equipment shelf and viewed the Earth through a special aperture in the side of the spacecraft.  A support structure extended radially from the thrust tube and was affixed to the solar panels, which formed the outer walls of the spacecraft and provided the primary source of electrical power.  Located in the annulus-shaped space between the thrust tube and the solar panels were stationkeeping and dynamics control equipment, batteries, and most of the SEM equipment.  Proper spacecraft attitude and spin rate (approximately 100 rpm) were maintained by two separate sets of jet thrusters mounted around the spacecraft equator and activated by ground command.  The spacecraft used both UHF-band and S-band frequencies in its telemetry and command subsystem.  A low-power VHF transponder provided telemetry and command during launch and then served as a backup for the primary subsystem once the spacecraft attained orbit. This spin-stabilized spacecraft carried a visible infrared spin-scan radiometer, meteorological data collection and relay system, space environment monitor, and a biaxial fluxgate magnetometer.  On December 1, 1978, responsibility for GOES 1 was turned over to ESA to be used as part of FGGE/GARP.  It was stationed over the Indian Ocean and controlled by ESOC in Darmstadt, F.R.G.  In December 1979, it was returned to the control of NOAA and positioned at 135 degrees West.  When GOES 5 VAS experienced a failure on July 30, 1984, GOES 6 was moved east and GOES 1 was reactivated by NOAA to provide visible imaging capability over the western U.S.  GOES 1 failed on February 3, 1985.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) is a cooperative program of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to operate a long-lived space-based  observatory for the benefit of the international astronomical   community. HST is an observatory first dream of in the 1940s,  designed and built in the 1970s and 80s, and operational only in the 1990s. Since its preliminary inception, HST was designed to be a different type of mission for NASA -- a long-term space-based observatory. To accomplish this goal and protect the spacecraft against instrument and equipment failures, NASA had   always planned on regular servicing missions. Hubble has special grapple fixtures, 76 handholds, and stabilized in all three axes. HST is a 2.4-meter reflecting telescope, which was deployed, in low-Earth orbit (600 kilometers) by the crew of the space shuttle Discovery (STS-31) on 25 April 1990.

Sunsat is a micro-satellite built by post-graduate engineering
students in the Electronic Systems Laboratory, in the Department
of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the University of
Stellenbosch.It was launched in 1999 on a Delta II Launch
Vehicle. Payloads include NASA experiments, Radio Amateur
communications, a high resolution imager, precision attitude

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Polarization and Anisotropy of Reflectances for Atmospheric Sciences coupled with Observations from a Lidar (PARASOL) is the second microsatellite in the Myriade series developed by CNES. It is carrying a wide-field imaging radiometer/polarimeter called POLDER (Polarization and Directionality of the Earth's Reflectances), designed in partnership with the LOA atmospheric optics laboratory in Lille (CNRS-USTL). POLDER is designed to improve our knowledge of the radiative and microphysical properties of clouds and aerosols by measuring the directionality and polarization of light reflected by the Earth-atmosphere system.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">                  - Spacecraft Brief Description -
This satellite was a part of Japan's contribution to the International
Magnetospheric Study. The mission objectives were to observe the aurora
borealis, study aurora-related phenomena, and study the ionosphere and
magnetosphere. The main body of the spacecraft was a cylinder 0.946 m in
diameter with shallow truncated cones attached at both ends. Most of the
surface was covered with solar cells that produced 35 W. Two booms of roughly
1.9 m each extended outward from the equator of the main body. At the tip of
each boom was a permanent magnet to provide alignment of the spacecraft center
axis along the local geomagnetic field line. Two sets of circularly polarized
quadrupole antennas, one for UHF (400 MHz) and another for VHF, extended from
opposite ends of the spacecraft. The VHF antenna was diplexed for telemetry
(136 MHz) and command (148 MHz). Other attitude sensors included a vector
magnetometer and a solar sensor. The spacecraft contained a tape recorder to
store 160 min of data at 512 bps or 40 min at 2048 bps, with readout in 10 min
at 8192 bps. Besides the solar cells, there was a nickel-cadmium battery for
nighttime operation.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">AIMP-1 (also known as AIMP-D or IMP-D or Explorer 33, NSSDC ID: 66-058A) was launched into a lunar orbit in order to 'anchor' it to the lunar distance from the earth.  AIMP-1 was a spin-stabilized spacecraft with spin axis parallel to the ecliptic plane, and spin period varying between 2.2 sec and 3.6 sec.  The spacecraft was instrumented for studies of interplanetary plasma, energetic charged particles [electrons, protons and helium ions (alpha particles)], magnetic fields, and solar X-rays at lunar distances. Unfortunately, the spacecraft failed to achieve lunar orbit but did achieve major mission objectives.  The initial AIMP-1 apogee occurred at about 16:00 hour local time.  Over the first 3-year period, perigee varied between 6 earth radii and 44 earth radii and apogee varied between 70 earth radii and 135 earth radii.  The inclination with respect to the equatorial plane of the earth varied between 7 degrees and 60 degrees.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The DE 2 spacecraft (low-altitude mission) complemented the high-altitude mission DE 1 and was placed into an orbit with a perigee sufficiently low to permit measurements of neutral composition, temperature, and wind. The apogee was high enough to permit measurements above the interaction regions of suprathermal ions, and also plasma flow measurements at the feet of the magnetospheric field lines. The general form of the spacecraft was a short polygon 137 cm in diameter and 115 cm high. The triaxial antennas were 23 m tip-to-tip. One 6-m boom was provided for remote measurements. The spacecraft weight was 403 kg. Power was supplied by a solar cell array, which charged two 6-ampere-hour nickel-cadmium batteries. The spacecraft was three-axis stabilized with the yaw axis aligned toward the center of the earth to within 1 deg. The spin axis was normal to the orbit plane within 1 deg with a spin rate of one revolution per orbit. A single-axis scan platform was included in order to mount the low-altitude plasma instrument (81-070B-08). The platform rotated about the spin axis. A pulse code modulation telemetry data system was used that operated in real time or in a tape-recorder mode. Data were acquired on a science-problem-oriented basis, with closely coordinated operations of the various instruments, both satellites, and supportive experiments. Measurements were temporarily stored on tape recorders before transmission at an 8:1 playback-to-record ratio. Since commands were also stored in a command memory unit, spacecraft operations were not real time.

ALOS is a Japanese Earth-Observation satellite, developed by JAXA. The
objective of the mission is to provide the user community with data of
sufficient resolution to be able to generate 1:25,000 scale maps. ALOS
mission objectives as set by JAXA are to:

- Develop digital elevation models (DEMs) and related geographic data
products
- Perform regional observation for 'sustainable development'
(harmonization between Earth environment and development)
- Conduct disaster monitoring around the world
- Survey natural resources
- Develop sensor and satellite technology for future Earth-observing
satellites

The mission includes optical and an active L-band microwave sensor
payload whose high-resolution data may be used for environmental and
hazard monitoring. ESA will provide the European/African node for data
distribution.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Heat Capacity Mapping Mission (HCMM) spacecraft was the first of a series
of Applications Explorer Missions (AEM).  The objective of the HCMM was to
provide comprehensive, accurate, high-spatial-resolution thermal surveys of the
surface of the earth.  The HCMM spacecraft was made of two distinct modules:
(1) an instrument module, containing the heat capacity mapping radiometer and
its supporting gear, and (2) a base module, containing the data handling,
power, communications, command, and attitude control subsystems required to
support the instrument module.  The spacecraft was spin stabilized at a rate of
14 rpm.
The HCMM circular sun-synchronous orbit allowed the spacecraft to sense surface
temperatures near the maximum and minimum of the diurnal cycle.  The orbit had
a daylight ascending node with nominal equatorial crossing time of 2:00 p.m.
Since there was no inclination adjustment capacity, the spacecraft drifted from
this crossing time by about 1 hour earlier per year.  There was no on-board
data storage capability, so only real-time data were transmitted when the
satellite came within reception range of seven ground stations.  The repeat
cycle of the spacecraft was 16 days.  Day/night coverage over a given area
between the latitudes of 85 deg N and 85 deg S occurred at intervals ranging
from 12 to 36 h (once every 16 days).
During February  21-23, 1980, the HCMM orbital altitude was lowered from 620 km
to 540 km to stop the drift of the orbit plane to unfavorable sun angles which
in turn reduced the power collection capability of the solar panels.  The
operations of the spacecraft were terminated on September 30, 1980.  More
detailed information can be found in the &amp;#039;Heat  Capacity  Mapping Mission
Users&amp;#039; Guide&amp;#039; (TRF B30282), available from NSSDC.

Certain ships of Canadian registry are fitted with this equipment
on a loan basis. The cup wheel and wind vane are mounted on
either end of a U - shaped arm. This U - arm is mounted as high
and as forward on the ship as possible, so that the unit is in a
flow of air relatively undisturbed by the ship's
superstructure. The instrument requires 115 volt, 60 cycle power
to operate the direction unit. The speed unit supplies its own
power by means of a small permanent magnet generator which is
operated by the rotating cup wheel.

The wind speed and direction dials are mounted in a small
cabinet located conveniently in the chart room or wheel
house. The wind speed dial is calibrated in nautical miles per
hour, from 0 to 1 00 knots. The wind direction dial is
calibrated in tens of degrees from 01 0? to 360?. The direction
indicated by the dial will be the direction of the apparent wind
in relation to the heading of the ship, and not to north. Thus
an indication of 360? represents an apparent wind from dead
ahead; 090?, a wind on the starboard beam; 180?, a wind from
dead astern; and 270?, a wind from the port beam.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">ATS 2 was launched in April 1967 and was a medium altitude,
gravity-gradient-stabilized spacecraft designed to (1) test new concepts in
spacecraft design, propulsion, and stabilization, (2) take high-quality
cloudcover pictures, (3) provide in situ measurements of the aerospace
environment, and (4) test improved communication systems.  The
cylindrically-shaped spacecraft measured 142 cm in diameter and 183 cm in
length.  The primary structural members were a corrugated thrust tube with
honeycombed bulkheads secured to each end.  Equipment components and payload
were externally mounted on the outer surface of the thrust tube as well as on a
structure that slid into the interior of the thrust tube.  Electric power was
provided by two solar arrays mounted on either end of the spacecraft's  outer
shell and by two rechargeable nickel-cadmium batteries.  Extending radially
outward from the side of the spacecraft were four 28.2 m adjustable
gravity-gradient booms.  The spacecraft telemetry system consisted of four
2.1-W transmitters (two at 136.47 MHz  and two at 137.35 MHz), in addition to a
microwave communications experiment.

This satellite carried a particle telescope, omnidirectional proton and
electron detectors, advanced vidicon camera system, and a electron magnetic
deflection spectrometer.  The second stage of the ATS 2 launch vehicle failed
to ignite resulting in an unplanned elliptical orbit.  Stresses induced by this
orbit eventually induced spacecraft tumbling.  In spite of these conditions
useful data were obtained from some of the experiments, most notably the
cosmic-ray and particle experiments and the field detection experiments.  The
satellite reentered the atmosphere on September 2, 1969.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">NOAA-1 (ITOS-1) was launched in December 1970 and the primary
objective of the sun-synchronous meteorological satellite was to
provide improved operational infrared and visual observations of earth
cloud cover for use in weather analysis and forecasting.  Secondary
objectives included providing solar proton and global heat balance
data on a regular daily basis.  The nearly cubical spacecraft measured
1 by 1 by 1.2 m. The TV cameras and infrared sensors were mounted on
the satellite baseplate with their optical axes directed vertically
earthward. The spacecraft was equipped with three curved solar panels
that were folded during launch and deployed after orbit was
achieved. Each panel measured over 4.2 m in length when unfolded and
was covered with 3420 solar cells, each measuring 2 by 2 cm. The
attitude control system maintained desired spacecraft orientation
through gyroscopic principles incorporated into the satellite
design. Earth orientation of the satellite body was maintained by
taking advantage of the precession induced from a momentum flywheel so
that the satellite body precession rate of one revolution per orbit
provided the desired 'earth looking' attitude. Minor adjustments in
attitude and orientation were made by means of magnetic coils and by
varying the speed of the momentum flywheel.
This spacecraft carried four cameras; two television cameras for
Automatic Picture Transmission (APT), and two Advanced Vidicon Camera
System (AVCS) cameras.  The satellite also carried a low-resolution
flat plate radiometer, a solar proton monitor, and two scanning
radiometers that not only measured emitted IR radiation but also
served as a backup system for the onboard cameras.  Launched into a
near-polar orbit, the spacecraft and its subsystems performed normally
until May 29, 1971 when the incremental tape recorder failed,
resulting in partial loss of solar proton data and total loss of flat
plate radiometer data. The APT and Direct Readout Infrared (DRIR)
subsystems were turned off on June 20, 1971 in an attempt to reduce
the above normal temperature due to overheating in the attitude
control system. The AVCS was turned off shortly thereafter, and the
scanning radiometer continued partial operations until the spacecraft
was deactivated on August 19, 1971.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Global Position System (GPS), counterpart to the Russian Global Navigation
System (GLONASS), is a United States Department of Defense (DoD) developed,
worldwide, satellite-based radionavigation system that will be the DoD's
primary radionavigation system well into the next century. The constellation
consists of 24 operational satellites. The U.S. Air Force Space Command (AFSC)
formally declared the GPS satellite constellation as having met the requirement
for Full Operational Capability (FOC) as of April 27, 1995. Requirements
include 24 operational satellites functioning in their assigned orbits and
successful testing completed for operational military functionality.

GPS consists of three segments, the SPACE, CONTROL and USER Segment:

1. The SPACE segment consists of 24 operational satellites in six orbital
planes, (four satellites in each plane). The satellites operate in circular
20,200 km orbits at an inclination angle of 55 degrees and with a 12-hour
period. The position is therefore the same at the same sidereal time each day,
i.e. the satellites appear four minutes earlier each day.

2. The CONTROL segment consists of five Monitor Stations, three Ground
Antennas, and a Master Control Station (MCS) located at Falcon AFB in Colorado.
The monitor stations passively track all satellites in view, accumulating
ranging data. This information is processed at the MCS to determine satellite
orbits and to update each satellite's navigation message. Updated information
is transmitted to each satellite via the Ground Antennas.

3. The USER segment consists of antennas and receiver-processors that
provide positioning, velocity and precise timing to the user.

GPS provides two levels of service, Standard Positioning Service and the
Precise Positioning Service. The Standard Positioning Service (SPS) is a
positioning and timing service which will be available to all GPS users on a
continuous, worldwide basis with no direct charge. The Precise Positioning
Service (PPS) is a highly accurate military positioning, velocity and timing
service which will be available on a continuous, worldwide basis to users
authorized by the U.S.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">During the 10 day mission, the Space Radar Laboratory (SRL) payload in Endeavour's cargo bay will make its second flight. The SRL payload, which first flew during STS-59 in April 1994, will again give scientists highly detailed information that will help them distinguish between human-induced environmental changes and other natural forms of change.

SRL-2 will take radar images of the Earth's surface for Earth system sciences studies, including geology, geography, hydrology, oceanography, agronomy and botany.

The SRL payload is comprised of the Spaceborne Imaging Radar-C/X-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SIR-C/X-SAR), and the Measurement of Air Pollution from Satellite (MAPS). The German Space Agency (DARA) and the Italian Space Agency (ASI) are providing the X-SAR instrument.

The imaging radar of the SIR-C/X-SAR instruments has the ability to make measurements over virtually any region at any time, regardless of weather or sunlight conditions. The radar waves can penetrate clouds, and under certain conditions, also can "see" through vegetation, ice and extremely dry sand. In many cases, radar is the only way scientists can explore inaccessible regions of the Earth's surface.

The SIR-C/X-SAR radar data provide information about how many of Earth's complex systems - those processes that control the movement of land, water, air and life - work together to make this a livable planet. The science team particularly wants to study the amount of vegetation coverage, the extent of snow packs, wetlands areas, geologic features such as rock types and their distribution, volcanic activity, ocean wave heights and wind speed. STS-68 will fly over the same sites that STS-59 observed so that scientists will be able to study seasonal changes that may have occurred in those areas between the missions.

An international team of 49 science investigators and three associates will conduct the SIR-C/X-SAR experiments. Thirteen nations are represented: Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and the United States.  The MAPS experiment will measure the global distribution of carbon monoxide in the troposphere, or lower atmosphere. Measurements of carbon monoxide, an important element in several chemical cycles, provide scientists with indications of how well the atmosphere can cleanse itself of "greenhouse gases," chemicals that can increase the atmosphere's temperature.

STS-68 provided a continuation of NASA's Get Away Special (GAS) experiments program. The project gives a person or organization a chance to perform experiments in space on a Shuttle mission. Two universities, North Carolina A&amp;T State University and University of Alabama in Huntsville, and the Swedish Space Corp., Soina, Sweden, will have small self-contained payloads flying during the STS-68 mission. Other GAS hardware in Endeavour's payload bay will carry 500,000 commemorative stamps for the U.S. Postal Service in recognition of the 25th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landing.

Other payloads aboard Endeavour include the Biological Research in Canister (BRIC) which will fly for the first time, and the Military Applications of Ship Tracks (MAST) which will be making its second flight. BRIC experiments, sponsored by NASA's Office of Life and Microgravity Sciences and Applications, are designed to examine the effects of microgravity on a wide range of physiological processes in higher order plants and arthropod animals (e.g., insects, spiders, centipedes, crustaceans). MAST is an experiment sponsored by the Office of Naval Research (ONR) and is part of a five-year research program developed by ONR to examine the effects of ships on the marine environment.

The Commercial Protein Crystal Growth (CPCG) experiment, the Chromosome and Plant Cell Division in Space Experiment (CHROMEX) and the Cosmic Radiation Effects and Activation Monitor (CREAM) experiment also will be carried aboard Endeavour.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">Sudden Ionospheric Disturbance Stations (SID) consists of solar observers who monitor very low frequency (VLF) radio stations for sudden enhancements of their signals. Earth's ionosphere reacts to the intense x-ray and ultraviolet radiation released during a solar flare. The ionospheric disturbance enhances VLF radio propagation. By monitoring the signal strength of a distant VLF transmitter, sudden ionospheric disturbances (SIDs) are recorded and indicate a recent solar flare event.

All SID monitoring stations are homebuilt by the observers. Instructions for constructing the VLF receiver and antenna can be obtained from the AAVSO Solar Division chairman. The receiver design has progressed remarkably as the SID program participants have been inspired to improve signal sensitivity and noise rejection. Recent SID station receivers follow a design developed by SID Technical Coordinator Art Stokes. The Stokes Gyrator receiver can be built and tuned by anyone with simple soldering skills. A small indoor loop antenna captures the radio wave for amplification and rectification by the receiver. The SID station operates unattended until the end of each month. Recordings are then analyzed for the beginning, end, and duration of SID events.

Evans flew the City of Washington while Truman flew the City of The Angels, now at the Piper Aviation Museum in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania.

The PA-12 was a more powerful J-5 Cruiser, with an electric starter, navigation lights, and a cabin heater. For the flight, Piper Aircraft arranged for second-hand planes and extra fuel tanks while radio and navigation equipment were also donated. Evans built a drift meter for each aircraft. Flags of each nation they visited were hand-painted on the fuselages' left sides and 53 of 55 city stops on the right sides.

The IRIS Global Seismographic Network (GSN) is one of the four
major components of the IRIS Consortium. The goal of the GSN is
to deploy 128 permanent seismic recording stations uniformly
over the earth's surface.

As of 2001 the GSN was made up of over 120 stations with
affiliations to IRIS USGS, IRIS IDA, GEOFON, Pacific21, NCDSN,
MedNet, BGR, BFO, USNSN, BDSN and several other national and
international networks. Thirteen new stations are planned for
completion in 2001/2002.

The IRIS GSN stations continuously record seismic data from very
broad band seismometers at 20 samples per second. It is also the
goal of the GSN to record data with a dynamic range of 140 db
(24 bit digitizers). Nearly all of the IRIS GSN stations meet
this goal.

DMSP 5D-2/F8 is one of a series of meteorological satellites developed and operated by the Air Force under the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). Its pre-launch designation was DMSP 5D-2/S9. This program, previously known as DAPP (Data Acquisition and Processing Program), was classified until March 1973. The objective of this program is to provide global visual and infrared cloudcover data and specialized environmental data to support Department of Defense operational weather analysis and forecasting requirements. Operationally, the program consists of two satellites in sun-synchronous polar orbits, with the ascending node of one satellite in early morning and the other at local noon. The 6.4-m-long spacecraft is separated into four sections: (1) a precision mounting platform for sensors and equipment requiring precise alignment; (2) an equipment support module containing the electronics, reaction wheels, and some meteorological sensors; (3) a reaction control equipment support structure containing the third-stage rocket motor and supporting the ascent phase reaction control equipment; and (4) a 9.29-sq-m solar cell panel. The spacecraft stabilization is controlled by a combination flywheel and magnetic control coil system so sensors are maintained in the desired earth-looking mode. One feature is the precision-pointing accuracy of the primary imager to 0.01 deg provided by a star sensor and an updated ephemeris navigation system. This allows automatic geographical mapping of the digital imagery to the nearest picture element. The operational linescan system is the primary data acquisition system that provides real-time or stored, multi-orbit, day-and-night, visual and infrared imagery of clouds. A supplementary sensor package contains five special sensors: (1) a microwave temperature sounder, (2) an advanced X-ray detector, (3) an ionospheric/scintillation monitor, (4) a precipitating electron/ion spectrometer, and (5) a microwave imager. An infrared temperature and moisture sounder and a magnetometer may also be included on this spacecraft. Either recorded or real-time data are transmitted to ground-receiving sites by two redundant S-band transmitters. Recorded data are read out to tracking sites located at Fairchild AFB, Wash., and at Loring AFB, Maine, and relayed by SATCOM to Air Force Global Weather Central, Offutt AFB, Nebraska. Real-time data are read out at mobile tactical sites located around the world. Additional information concerning this satellite program can be found in the report by D. A. Nichols, "The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program," Optical Engineering, v. 14, n. 4, p. 273, July-August, 1975.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">STEREO (Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory) is a 2-year NASA mission
employing two nearly identical space-based observatories to provide the very
first, 3-D "stereo" images of the sun to study the nature of coronal mass
ejections. These powerful solar eruptions are a major source of the magnetic
disruptions on Earth and a key component of space weather, which can greatly
affect satellite operations, communications, power systems, the lives of humans
in space, and global climate.

STEREO is the third mission in NASA's Solar Terrestrial Probes Program. The
twin observatories launched aboard a single Boeing Delta II rocket from Cape
Canaveral Air Force Station, Fla., on Oct. 25, 2006, at 8:52 p.m. EDT.

STEREO is sponsored by NASA Headquarters' Science Mission Directorate,
Washington, D.C. NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's Solar Terrestrial Probes
Program Office, in Greenbelt, Md., manages the mission, instruments and science
center. The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL), in
Laurel, Md., designed and built the spacecraft and will operate the twin
observatories for NASA during the mission.

The two spacecraft are launched to drift slowly away from the Earth in opposite
directions at about 10 degrees per year for the lagging spacecraft and 20
degrees per year for the leading one. Optimal longitudinal separation of about
sixty degrees is achieved after two years. Afterwards the separation gradually
increases beyond the design lifetime of two years with the possibility of
extended mission observations at larger angles. Science instruments selected
for STEREO include the Sun Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric
Investigation (SECCHI) for extreme ultraviolet (EUV), white-light
coronographic, and heliospheric imaging, the STEREO/WAVES (SWAVES)
interplanetary radio burst tracker, the In situ Measurements of Particles and
CME Transients (IMPACT) investigation for in-situ sampling the 3-D distribution
and plasma characteristics of solar energetic particles and the interplanetary
magnetic field, and the PLAsma and SupraThermal Ion and Composition (PLASTIC)
experiment to measure elemental and charge composition of ambient and CME
plasma ions. STEREO data recorded and stored onboard each spacecraft will be
downlinked through the NASA Deep Space Network on a daily schedule. Real-time
space weather data will be continuously transmitted through a separate beacon
system to NASA and non-NASA receiving stations.

[This Mission is Under Study]

The Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory (CLARREO) Mission has been recommended in the NRC Decadal Survey as a key component of the future climate observing system. NASA and NOAA share responsibility for CLARREO. The NOAA component involves the continuity of measurements of incident solar irradiance and Earth energy budget by flying the TSIS and CERES sensors that were removed from NPOESS. The NASA portion involves the measurement of spectrally resolved thermal IR and reflected solar radiation at high absolute accuracy. Coupled with measurements from on-board GPS radio occultation receivers, these measurements will provide a long-term benchmarking data record for the detection, projection, and attribution of changes in the climate system. In addition, the SI traceable radiances will provide a source of absolute calibration for a wide range of visible and IR Earth observing sensors, greatly increasing their value for climate monitoring.

CLARREO is a Highly Leveraged Interdisciplinary Climate Change Mission

 - Accurate decadal-length records are essential for climate change detection, attribution, and for testing climate prediction accuracy. They represent the most critical test of uncertainty in future climate change prediction.

- While process study missions (e.g. CALIPSO/CloudSat) are critical to improve underlying climate model physics (e.g. clouds), decadal change observations are critical to determine the impact of those climate model improvements on the accuracy of predicting future climate change. Both elements are critical, and CLARREO is the major Decadal Study mission addressing serious accuracy issues in decadal climate change observation.
 
- The CLARREO mission is unique in its broad interdisciplinary impact on climate change science: the other NRC Decadal Survey missions are primarily focused on one climate process or discipline.

- CLARREO provides new solar reflected and infrared emitted high spectral resolution benchmark radiance climate data records that can be used to test climate model predictions, improve climate change fingerprinting, and attribution.

- CLARREO provides an orbiting calibration observatory that can be used to calibrate other solar and infrared space-borne sensors (e.g. VIIRS, CrIS, Landsat, Geostationary, CERES) and thereby improve to climate accuracy a wide range of sensors across the GEO observing system. It also improves the scientific value of all of these instruments.

- Key climate variable decadal records impacted by CLARREO include: atmospheric temperature and water vapor profiles, land and sea surface temperatures, cloud properties, radiation budget including Earths albedo, vegetation, surface snow and ice properties, ocean color, and aerosols. The data is also relevant to greenhouse gas monitoring.

- The absolute accuracy of CLARREO, when used to calibrate other sensors in orbit can dramatically reduce the impact of data gaps on decadal change data records across many climate variables.

- CLARREO provides the first spectrally resolved climate observation of the Far-Infrared spectrum from 15 to 50 micron wavelengths, where half of the thermal infrared emission of the earth to space occurs, and the source of almost all of the Earth's water vapor greenhouse effect.

- CLARREO’s ability to calibrate other instruments across the full solar and infrared spectrum can change the future prioritization of different elements of instrument pre-launch characterization (e.g. spectral response), stability, and calibration, thereby resulting in increased programmatic flexibility and savings.

It covers the United States every 16 days. Operations were transferred to USGS on Fall 2000.

The Landsat Project is a joint initiative of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the NASA to gather Earth resource data using a series of satellites. NASA was responsible for developing and launching the spacecrafts, while the USGS is responsible for flight operations, maintenance, and management of all ground data reception, processing, archiving, product generation, and distribution.

The primary objective of the Landsat Project is to ensure a collection of consistently calibrated Earth imagery. Landsat&amp;#039;s Global Survey Mission is to establish and execute a data acquisition strategy that ensures repetitive acquisition of observations over the Earth&amp;#039;s land mass, coastal boundaries, and coral reefs; and to ensure the data acquired are of maximum utility in supporting the scientific objectives of monitoring changes in the Earth&amp;#039;s land surface and associated environment.

Due to the success of CBERS-1 and 2, the two governments decided, in November 2002, to give continuity to the CBERS program by signing a new agreement for the development and launch of two more satellites, CBERS-3 and 4.

Brazilian participation in this program will be enlarged up to 50%, thus taking Brazil to a condition of equality with its partner. CBERS-3 is expected to be launched in 2009, CBERS-4 in 2011.

CBERS-3 and 4 satellites represent an evolution of CBERS-1 and 2. Four cameras will be present in the payload module, with improved geometrical and radiometric performance.

They are: PanMux Camera-PANMUX, Multi-spectral Camera-MUXCAM, Scanning Medium Resolution Scanner-IRSCAM and Wide Field Imaging Camera-WFICAM.

The orbits of the two satellites will be the same as for CBERS-1 and 2.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Apollo program was designed to land humans on the Moon and
bring them safely back to Earth. Six of the missions (Apollos
11, 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17) achieved this goal. Apollos 7 and 9
were Earth orbiting missions to test the Command and Lunar
Modules, and did not return lunar data. Apollos 8 and 10 tested
various components while orbiting the Moon, and returned
photography of the lunar surface. Apollo 13 did not land on the
Moon due to a malfunction, but also returned photographs. The
six missions that landed on the Moon returned a wealth of
scientific data and almost 400 kilograms of lunar
samples. Experiments included soil mechanics, meteoroids,
seismic, heat flow, lunar ranging, magnetic fields, and solar
wind experiments.

NASA's Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) aims to resolve one of the oldest mysteries in space physics, namely to determine what physical process in near-Earth space initiates the violent eruptions of the aurora that occur during substorms in the Earth's magnetosphere.

THEMIS is a 2-year mission consisting of 5 identical probes that will study the violent colorful eruptions of Auroras.

For the first time NASA will launch a constellation of five satellites to study substorms. The THEMIS probes will line up over North America once every four days. Over the mission’s two-year lifetime, the probes should be able to observe some 30 substorms.

THEMIS is the fifth medium-class mission under NASA's Explorer Program, which was conceived to provide frequent flight opportunities for world-class scientific investigations from space within the Heliophysics and Astrophysics science areas. The Explorers Program Office at Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., manages this NASA-funded mission. The University of California, Berkeley's Space Sciences Laboratory and Swales Aerospace, Beltsville, Md., built the THEMIS probes.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">The Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) program is a joint effort of the National Weather Service (NWS), the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the Department of Defense (DOD). The ASOS systems serves as the nation's primary surface weather observing network. ASOS is designed to support weather forecast activities and aviation operations and, at the same time, support the needs of the meteorological, hydrological, and climatological research communities.

With the largest and most modern complement of weather sensors, ASOS has significantly expanded the information available to forecasters and the aviation community. The ASOS network has more than doubled the number of full-time surface weather observing locations. ASOS works non-stop, updating observations every minute, 24 hours a day, every day of the year.

Elements Reported:

1. Sky condition:cloud height and amount (clear, scattered,
broken, overcast) up to 12,000 feet

2. Visibility (to at least 10 statute miles)

3. Basic present weather information: type and intensity for
rain, snow, and freezing rain

4. Obstructions to vision: fog, haze

5. Pressure: sea-level pressure, altimeter setting

6. Ambient temperature, dew point temperature

7. Wind: direction, speed and character (gusts, squalls)

8. Precipitation accumulation

9. Selected significant remarks including- variable cloud
height, variable visibility, precipitation beginning/ending
times, rapid pressure changes, pressure change tendency, wind
shift, peak wind

[Text For Archival Purposes only]

GOES-11 (GOES-L) was launched May 3, 2000 from Cape Canaveral Air Station. The spacecraft will continue the long term geostationary monitoring of U.S. weather. The spacecraft will monitor hurricanes, severe thunderstorms, flash floods, and other severe weather as well as provide short-term weather forecasting or nowcasting. Combined with Doppler radar and automated surface weather stations, real-time GOES data will greatly aid weather foecasters in providing better warnings of severe weather.

NOAA's National Environmmental Satellite, Data, and Information Service will operate GOES. The instrument package includes a GOES I-M Imager and GOES I-M Sounder.

    <skos:definition xml:lang="en">GFZ-1 (GeoForschungsZentrum-1) is a geodetic satellite designed to improve the
current knowledge of the Earth's gravity field. The satellite, a passive system
with no onboard sensors or electronics, is covered with retroreflectors that
reflect laser beams sent from ground stations. By measuring the round trip time
of the transmitted light, the distance between the satellite and the station
can be determined with approximately 1 centimeter. These measurements are used
to determine variations in the rotational characteristics of the Earth and for
measurement of the Earth's gravitational field. As the vehicle's orbit decays,
the satellite's orbital motion will also be used calculate to atmospheric
densities. Deployed from the Mir space station, GFZ-1 was the first non-Russian
satellite launched from MIR. GFZ-1 was developed in under 12 months and cost
approximately &amp;#36700,000 (including design, fabrication, test, and launch).
Data collection, distribution and evaluation is coor dinated by the project's
scientists at the GeoForschungsZentrum Potsdam.

Spacecraft The satellite consists of a spherical body made from brass with 60
corner cube reflectors distributed regularly over the satellite's surface.
These retroreflectors are quartz prisms placed in special holders that are
recessed in the satellite's body. External metallic surfaces are covered with
white paint for thermal control purposes and to facilitate visual observation
in space. The vehicle's size was limited by the maximum allowable dimensions of
the Mir airlock (30 cm). The vehicle carries no electronics or sensors and is
not attitude controlled.
